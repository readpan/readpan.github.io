1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 The history of our story began long ago.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:12,500
 At one point in time, around three billion years ago,

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
 we were floating around as little tiny atoms in the little Petri dish of the world.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Fast forward to around six million years ago,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 and we see the emergence of the first hominids,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 the family of primates that include humans.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,500
 1.9 million years ago,

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,000
 Homo erectus was the first species to leave Africa

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,500
 and colonize other parts of the world.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,500
 They had larger brains than their primate ancestors.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,500
 Around 400,000 years ago, the first evidence of the Neanderthals.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
 Their bodies were adapted to the cold environments of Europe and Western Asia.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,500
 Their distinctive facial features were some of the most human-like ever seen.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 Then came us.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,000
 The only surviving species of the homogeneous.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 But how did Homo sapiens rise into a global dominance through the mechanism of civilization?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:22,500
 We begin our story in the fertile lands of Mesopotamia in 4000 BCE,

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,000
 nestled between the great Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the Sumerian city of Uric.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Instead of relying on hunting and gathering like our ancestors of the past,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 the citizens of Uric were able to develop a way to harvest cereal grains, like wheat and barley.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 However, turning cereal grains into edible foods took a lot of work.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 In the beginning, they had to use an invention called a hand mill, which consisted of two stones.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 As the grains were crushed between the two stones, the flower was collected in a container and stored for future use.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 This was the start of something great.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 This complex strenuous process was our modern world's first example of agriculture.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,500
 We no longer depended on hunting animals or picking berries for our food.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 Rather than using human ingenuity, we can create our own food source.

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 This allowed Uric to prosper into a place with over 50,000 residents.

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 However, this change did have a change on the human body.

30
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 The average height of men drastically shrunk from 5'9" to 5'3",

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,000
 and for women, they shrunk on average from 5'3" to 5' feet.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,500
 Instead of being the super athletes we were of the past, we were smaller, less noticeable farmers.

33
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 People also became landlocked, changing the very essence of what it means to be human.

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,500
 In the early 3000 BCE, according to legend, King Gilgamesh began his rule as a Sumerian king of his region.

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 One of the world's earliest poems, the Epic of Gilgamesh, describes the story of Gilgamesh and his quest for immortality.

36
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 He meets a wise traveler named Yudnapishtim, who tells a story of a great flood sent to destroy the world.

37
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 Towards the poem's end, Gilgamesh says, "Life which you look for, you will never find."

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:25,500
 For when God's created man, they let death be his share, and life withheld in their own hands.

39
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,500
 However, by the end of 3000 BCE, the Acadians ousted the Sumerians.

40
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 Sargan the Great took power and conquered all of Sumeria.

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 While in the Indus Valley in modern-day Pakistan, a new civilization was growing.

42
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 The Indus Valley Civilization, 3300 to 1300 BCE, was most notable for its highly advanced toilet system.

43
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,500
 The toilets were built with a seat and a chute that led to the underground drainage system.

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 The sewage was then carried away from the homes through a network of covered drains, preventing disease spread.

45
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,500
 The waste was treated and disposed outside of city limits, helping to keep the cities clean and hygienic.

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 While in Egypt, they were more consumed with building pyramids than basic human plumbing.

47
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 This was because, in ancient Egyptian religion, it was believed that when a pharaoh was to die in the physical world,

48
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,500
 his spirit would continue to live on in the afterlife, in which they would continue to rule in perpetuity

49
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 and where they would be worshipped by the living.

50
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 Inside these pyramids, the pharaoh's body was carefully mummified.

51
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 A process believed to preserve his physical form and help ensure his spirit's journey to the afterlife.

52
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,500
 The pyramid was also filled with offerings and treasures intended to provide the pharaoh with the resources he would need in the afterlife.

53
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,500
 Every pharaoh wanted to make sure they were immortal.

54
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 They wanted to succeed in the afterlife.

55
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 They wanted to be worshipped forever.

56
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:12,500
 That's why it was an utmost priority for Egyptian pharaohs to build pyramids for themselves when laid to rest.

57
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 It started when Pharaoh Joser 2667-2648 BCE built the step pyramid at Zakara.

58
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 Followed by Snefuru 2613-2589 BCE who built several pyramids, such as the bent pyramid and the red pyramid.

59
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 Then came the pharaoh Khufu, 2589-2566 BCE, who built the famous great pyramid of Giza in a labor-intensive 20-year process.

60
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 One that the world still marvels at today.

61
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:55,500
 Khufu was then followed by Pharaoh's Kafre and Menkar, who built the slightly smaller second and third pyramids of Giza respectively.

62
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 While over in China in the year 2100 BCE, the first Chinese dynasty was upon us.

63
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:14,500
 Like the people of Mesopotamia, the Chinese were ever reliant on agriculture, producing rice, weed and barley among other crops.

64
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,500
 However, as legend has it, the Yellow River flooded.

65
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 These massive floods would destroy all the crops, leading to massive famine and suffering.

66
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 However, not all was to be lost because you the Great was on his way.

67
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 You was so distraught by this problem that he would spend his days traveling up and down the Yellow River.

68
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:42,500
 He found ways to divert the rivers by building levees and dikes, so that he could regulate the waterways.

69
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 Then, after 13 years of hard work, the floods could no longer wreak havoc on the land.

70
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,500
 The people were overjoyed, and you was hailed as a savior.

71
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 That was the start of the first Chinese dynasty, the Zh'a dynasty.

72
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 Though the accuracy of this tale is questioned by historians, it does establish an important precedent.

73
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,500
 The idea is that power ought to follow one's merit, an individual who deserves absolute power shall have absolute power.

74
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 This idea would shape the world for years to come, and cause the people of ancient China to follow him, to create the first ever Chinese dynasty.

75
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 While back over in Mesopotamia, around 1772 BCE, a Babylonian king named King Hammurabi created the basis of the legal system as we know it today.

76
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 Hammurabi ordered the creation of a 7-foot tall, 2-foot wide stone slab.

77
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 Written on it was a system of 282 laws that each citizen of his kingdom was to follow.

78
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 Such laws included various laws such as "law 1" if a man brings an accusation against another man, charging him with murder but cannot prove it.

79
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 The accuser shall be put to death.

80
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 Law 196.

81
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 If a man destroys the eye of another man, they shall destroy his eye.

82
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 Law 197 says, "If he breaks another man's bone, they shall break it."

83
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 Law 199. "If he destroys the eye of a man's slave or breaks the bone of a man's slave, he shall pay one half his price."

84
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 However, what King Hammurabi did was create a society based on laws.

85
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 He laid out strict laws, placing people into certain casts of life and value.

86
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,500
 Everyone was worth a different amount based on what class they were in society.

87
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
 There was no illusion of equality in ancient Babylon.

88
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 Instead, it was pretty clear the value of a noble's bone was worth more than a plebeiance, which in turn was worth more than a slave's.

89
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,500
 An idea we continue to see throughout history.

90
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 While in modern-day Turkey, a lesser-known civilization came to power.

91
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 The Hittites Empire, under the charismatic rule of the leader Labarnus, 1680-1650 BCE,

92
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 he was a skilled ruler with a single vision in mind, uniting the Hittites city-states under a single rule.

93
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:30,500
 Labarnus led his army from city to city, conquering neighboring city-states and making alliances with their leaders.

94
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 He was a shrewd diplomat, and he used his diplomatic skills to win over the hearts and minds of the people.

95
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 Eventually, Labarnus became the ruler of all the Hittite city-states and established the empire.

96
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,500
 He was a just and fair ruler and was loved by his people.

97
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 Under his rule, the Hittites prospered, and their territory expanded, leaving them right next to their neighbors in Egypt.

98
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 While in modern-day Greece, a collection of city-states emerged on the European continent.

99
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 Mycenae in Greece, 1600 BCE to 1100 BCE, was dominated by an elite warrior society

100
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 and consisted of a network of palace-centered states that developed rigid,

101
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 higher-archical, political, social, and economic systems.

102
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 At the head of this society was the king.

103
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,500
 However, unlike a unified civilization, each city was on its own.

104
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 A city-state is a city that, with its surrounding territory, forms an independent state.

105
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 The development of city-states such as Troy, Mycenae, and Pilus start to grow.

106
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,500
 The first remnants of the Greek-written language, known as Linear B, also started to emerge.

107
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 The first record of any Indo-European Greek record we have today.

108
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,500
 While back in Egypt, they started to create a social pyramid of another type,

109
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 the Egyptian social pyramid. Like the great pyramid of Giza, it is more prominent at the bottom and tinier at the top.

110
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,500
 At the bottom lays the peasants and the slaves.

111
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,500
 They were responsible for doing all the manual labor. They worked on the lands.

112
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 They would spend the day in and day out farming, producing food for all of Egypt.

113
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,500
 Then, when the season to farm was over for the year, they would work on the Pharaoh's massive building projects,

114
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,500
 literally building the pyramids.

115
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 Slightly above the slaves came the artisans.

116
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 They were the stonemasons, the plasters, and the sculptors, who created the exuberant art the wealthy desired.

117
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 And for Egypt is most known for today.

118
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 Then came the merchants, who spent their days navigating the Nile,

119
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 trading gold, papyrus, and linen to anyone who could afford it.

120
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 They were well respected and able to make a healthy profit by selling.

121
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 Then came the scribes.

122
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:10,500
 These masters of the world would go to specialized scribe schools just to master the language of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

123
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 In practical use, these scribes took account of the stores of food, various tax documents,

124
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
 and even the daily lives of the Pharaoh.

125
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 After the scribes came the soldiers.

126
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
 The soldiers were tasked with protecting the Egyptian Empire.

127
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 They dedicated their lives to defend or make preemptive strikes against their enemy.

128
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 Generally, they were well fed.

129
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
 Then, near the top, came the bureaucrats.

130
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,500
 These high-ranking government officials did essential tasks at the top of society,

131
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,500
 like the viziers, who ran the logistical tasks necessary to run a civilization.

132
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 The priests oversaw taking care of the temples to ensure the gods were well cared for.

133
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 The nobles oversaw specific regions of the empire and kept order in said regions.

134
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 At the top, the purpose of everyone below was the Pharaoh, the king in the mediator between the gods and the world of men.

135
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 The pharaohs will be known to be supreme, and all must succumb to it.

136
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 When the Pharaoh dies, he will be buried in a pyramid in which he will help eternally rule over the Egyptian Empire.

137
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,500
 Egyptian society was created to serve the Pharaoh.

138
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,500
 Taxes were taken from the farmers for the Pharaoh, and artisans made unique crafts for it.

139
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 The merchants ensured the Pharaoh was well supplied with the needed goods.

140
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
 The scribes would follow the Pharaoh and record his thoughts.

141
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,500
 The soldiers made sure his empire was protected.

142
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 The bureaucrats, to the jobs the Pharaoh couldn't do, while the Pharaoh sat at the top and communicated with the gods.

143
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 Pharaoh Ramses II, 1279-1213 BCE, accomplished many extraordinary things by living in this social system.

144
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 He orchestrated the construction of the Temple of Abu Simbal, the Ramazim, and the Temple of Karnak.

145
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 He was also able to grow the Egyptian Empire and reconquer lands lost by other pharaohs, except for the land claimed by the Hittite Empire.

146
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 The Hittite king of the time, M'twali II, 1295-1272 BCE, was notorious for ordering his troops to attack his Egyptian neighbors.

147
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,500
 Following the example of the Barnas, M'twali wanted to unify the world under Hittite rule.

148
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
 However, Ramses had enough.

149
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,500
 Other pharaohs in the past have tried to stop the Hittites, but he knew if his empire was to ever succeed.

150
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 He needed to attack back.

151
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
 His target is the city of Kadesh.

152
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,500
 Ramses rode in on his chariot with four divisions of 20,000 men ready to dominate and kill M'twali.

153
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,500
 However, the Hittites already knew of the incoming Egyptian invasion through espionage.

154
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 They fortified their city with 40,000 of his own men.

155
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 A war was about to commence.

156
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 Ramses decided to split up his divisions to force M'twali out, but yet M'twali never did.

157
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 A gruesome mistake.

158
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 Splitting up his forces left him exposed, unable to get an advantage, allowing M'twali and the people of Kadesh a chance for victory.

159
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 Historians believe that all they did was come out from the fortification of Kadesh,

160
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,500
 and trap Ramses the second's forces in his army by the river.

161
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:45,500
 But yet, for some unknown reason, they never did, leaving the Battle of Kadesh to end in a draw.

162
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,500
 After the battle though, both sides decided it would be best to stop attacking each other.

163
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 That they should live in peace and unity in this world.

164
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,500
 Then, after the death of M'twali, the new king, Haddusili III, took the throne of the Hittite Empire.

165
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 Through the means of messengers in the year 1258 BCE, both Ramses and Haddusili signed the first peace treaty to ever exist.

166
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 Reading in part, Ramses the Great King, the King of the country of Egypt,

167
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 shall never attack the country of Haddi to take possession of a part of this country.

168
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:30,500
 And Haddusili, the great king of the country of Haddi, shall never attack the country of Egypt to take possession of a part of that country.

169
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 Then, a period of friendship occurred between these two once-worring nations.

170
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,500
 The Hittites were skilled in metalwork and taught the Egyptians to make superior weapons and tools.

171
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 At the same time, the Egyptians, Master of Agriculture, shared their knowledge with the Hittites,

172
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 trade for the benefit of both civilizations.

173
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 Both civilizations prospered because of this.

174
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 Peace can lead to prosperity.

175
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 The agreement was kept in place until around 1200 BCE, because that's when the Hittite Empire fell,

176
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,500
 because of the constant attacks they faced from the sea people,

177
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 leaving the Hittite Empire to be lost in the state of history.

178
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 While on a continent far away, the first civilization in the Americas was taking foot in modern-day Mexico.

179
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:35,500
 The Olmec civilization, 1200 BCE to 400 BCE, is often considered the mother civilization of Native American civilizations.

180
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 However, sadly though, not much is known about them. Mainly due to their writing in a hieroglyph,

181
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 historians still can't decipher.

182
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 One of the few remains we have are the 17 Colossal Stone Heads.

183
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:58,500
 In Mesoamerican culture, there is this belief that the head alone could contain an individual's emotion, experience, and soul.

184
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 We may not know their leader's names, like of other civilizations, like Ramses and Hammurabi,

185
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 when looking through the eyes of a stone head, we can still feel their presence.

186
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:19,500
 And in some ways they remain immortal and shined in history for one day we may learn who they are.

187
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,500
 While in the east, the Zhou Dynasty 1046 to 256 BCE in China was taking its stride.

188
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,500
 The Zhou Dynasty gained power because of the failures of the less critical shang dynasty.

189
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
 They believed in the idea of a mandate from heaven.

190
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 This resulted in four principles in the Chinese dynastical structure that would be repeated repeatedly.

191
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 One, heaven grants the emperor the right to rule.

192
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,500
 Two, since there is only one heaven, there can only be one emperor at any given time.

193
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 Three, the emperor's virtue determines his right to rule, and four, no one dynasty has a permanent right to rule.

194
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 A ruler in dynasty could lose the mandate from heaven, and the heavens weren't always on the side of the rulers.

195
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 Over time it will fade into another dynasty.

196
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 The heavens would send signs of droughts, famines, floods, and earthquakes across the land,

197
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
 signaling they'd lost the blessing from above.

198
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 This is how the shang dynasty fell, and the Zhou Dynasty grew to prominence.

199
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 The Zhou Dynasty brought another style of government and the creation of feudalism.

200
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 The system was straightforward, leading to another social pyramid.

201
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,500
 At the bottom lay the peasants, who were tied to the land and whose job was to produce crops for the empire.

202
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 Then came the soldiers, whose job was to protect the lands from foreign invaders.

203
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,500
 Then the lords, who owned the land and taxed the peasants a portion of their crops.

204
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,500
 Who in turn, the lord gave some of their crops to the king.

205
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 The person in charge of the whole empire, the king, would then receive more crops and become very wealthy.

206
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 All profits go to the king, and all work goes to the masses.

207
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,500
 Why would anyone just settle for a life of farming day in and day out?

208
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
 There are two reasons for this phenomenon.

209
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 The first reason was due to necessity.

210
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 It took many more people to feed an empire and a family back then.

211
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 And the second reason being philosophy.

212
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 Towards the end of the Zhou Dynasty, the beginning of Eastern philosophy was created.

213
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
 Confucius created a philosophy system justly named Confucianism,

214
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,500
 which is focused on the importance of respect, loyalty and responsibility in all relationships and life.

215
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,500
 A central concept of Confucianism is called Li,

216
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,500
 which can be translated as rituals, customs or manners.

217
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 Li refers to the formal and informal social conventions that guide societal behavior.

218
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,500
 It is seen as maintaining order and harmony in social relationships.

219
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,500
 While Lao Zee created another philosophy called Taoism.

220
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 The word Tao means "the way" or "the path".

221
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:11,500
 And Taoism teaches that individuals should seek to align themselves with the natural flow of the universe.

222
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 Rather than fighting against it, live your life as peacefully with yourself as possible.

223
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 And don't worry about external things outside your control.

224
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
 Just focus on your farming.

225
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 One of the most famous contemporaries from Taoism is the idea of Yin and Yang,

226
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 representing complementary and interdependent forces in nature, such as light and dark,

227
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 hot and cold, or masculine and feminine.

228
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 Taoism teaches that by balancing these opposing forces,

229
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
 individuals can achieve harmony and fulfillment.

230
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 Confucianism and Taoism made life bearable for ancient Chinese farmers.

231
00:21:51,500 --> 00:22:00,500
 But as time progressed, the city states that occupied ancient Greece grew.

232
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:07,500
 Around 800 BCE, the Greek city started to realize that the land they occupied was practically infertile.

233
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,500
 So to produce an essential staple of grain, they had to import it.

234
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 Hence why the Greek states had to colonize the world around them.

235
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,500
 The city state Miletus, at its height, had over 90 colonies throughout Europe,

236
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 producing food for the Greeks.

237
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 At its height, the Greek had set up colonies from modern-day Marseilles in France to Rostov on dawn in Russia.

238
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 One of these new emerging city states was Rome.

239
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,500
 As a legend has it, Romulus and Remus were twin brothers abandoned by their parents

240
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 and placed into the river Tibet.

241
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 As the basket floated across the river, a female wolf discovered the two orphans

242
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 and nursed them back to health.

243
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 When Romulus and Remus became adults, they decided to find a city where the wolf rescued them.

244
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 However, this created turmoil as both brothers wanted the site to be named after themselves.

245
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 As Romulus and Remus fought relentlessly, eventually Romulus came up with the final blow and killed Remus,

246
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 creating Rome in 753 BC.

247
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:22,500
 While the Greek city states might have been colonizing, Cyrus the Great was about to take over an empire.

248
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 At the time, the Persians were subjugated to the rule of the Medes Empire.

249
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:34,500
 According to legend, after his grandson Cyrus was born, King Astianges of Medes had a vivid dream

250
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 that his little grandson would one day stage a revolt against him.

251
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,500
 King Astianges knew what to do and ordered his chief advisor to kill the baby.

252
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 But the chief advisor gave the baby off to a shepherd to be raised instead.

253
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,500
 However, troubles weren't over for Cyrus.

254
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
 When he was 10, King Astianges found Cyrus.

255
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 King Astianges wanted to kill him because the dream was very clear.

256
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 This man will revolt against you.

257
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 Yet against his better senses, Cyrus was allowed to live.

258
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 King Astianges' biggest mistake.

259
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 When Cyrus was a man, he gathered his army and revolted against his maternal grandfather.

260
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 The two, but as prophecy had it, Astianges surrendered in 550 BCE.

261
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 However, Cyrus wasn't done conquering.

262
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 He conquered Babylon and became the supreme ruler of Mesopotamia, and even the Indus Valley Civilization.

263
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
 The world was in Cyrus' hand.

264
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,500
 Cyrus then took over the Greek colony of Ionia in Asia Minor, leading a great Persian empire.

265
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 And then he died, leaving it all in the air for the next great Persian king, Darius the Great.

266
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:56,500
 While back in Greece, various city-states started to gain power.

267
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 But two were at the forefront, Sparta and Athens.

268
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 Sparta was a military powerhouse.

269
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 The famous Spartans believed everything should focus on physical strength and war.

270
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 When a new young Spartan was born, it would be slaughtered if it didn't look healthy.

271
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 Boys were taken from their families at a young age and were trained to become soldiers.

272
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 The brutal training included physical conditioning, weapons training, and harsh living conditions.

273
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,500
 The entire life of a Spartan was to win a war.

274
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 Their society reflects it with three main groups.

275
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,500
 The ruling class consisted of aristocrats who held political power.

276
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 The free non-citizens, who were not allowed to participate in government,

277
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,500
 but were still expected to serve in the military, and the helots,

278
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 a group of enslaved people that provided labor for the Spartan state.

279
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 Life in Sparta was harsh, brutal, and militaristic.

280
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 While their neighbors up north were experimenting with this idea of democracy,

281
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,500
 Athenian democracy was a highly complicated mess.

282
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 There were two branches, the Council of 500, and the Assembly.

283
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 The Council of 500 was selected randomly by a process known as "Sortician".

284
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 Athens itself was made up of ten different tribes.

285
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 Each tribe was responsible for providing 50 citizens to serve for one year in the Council of 500 via a random selection.

286
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 Each eligible citizen would be given a personalized token.

287
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 Those tokens were inserted into a particular machine called a "Claraterian".

288
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 This long-lost technology included tubes and balls,

289
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 which somehow selected 50 residents of each tribe to join the illustrious Council of 500.

290
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,500
 While in the Assembly, there was a system in place that said that every single citizen had a vote.

291
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 Of course, to be a citizen, you had to be a male and not a slave,

292
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 and either born in Athens or to Athenian parents.

293
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,500
 The Council of 500 would create the agenda for the main Assembly to vote on,

294
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 because over 30,000 people could have a vote at any given time.

295
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 It was total chaos.

296
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,500
 So, to quell this, the Council would nominate nine presidents the morning of the meeting,

297
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 and it was their job to ensure all the rules and procedures were being followed.

298
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,500
 Since they were appointed right before the Assembly met, they were almost impossible to bribe.

299
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 Somehow, the Assembly would loudly vote on whether a bill would pass.

300
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 They would vote on matters like appointing generals, various laws, and other government bureaucracy.

301
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 However, not everyone liked this Athenian democracy.

302
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,500
 The famous Greek philosopher Plato thought the idea was barbaric.

303
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,500
 In Book VI of the seminal book The Republic, Plato writes,

304
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,500
 "The true navigator must study the seasons of the year.

305
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 The sky, the stars, the winds, and all the other subjects appropriate to his profession

306
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 if he is really fit to control the ship.

307
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,500
 Think that it's quite impossible to acquire the professional skill needed for such control,

308
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,500
 and that there's no such thing as the art of navigation."

309
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 How much could a randomly selected member of the Council of 500 really know?

310
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
 How much could he fully contribute to society?

311
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 Should we allow a random member of society to have any power?

312
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,500
 Instead, Plato would advocate for the idea of a philosopher king,

313
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500
 a man who studies wisdom, logic, and reasoning,

314
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 a man who dedicates his life to understanding how to be just,

315
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 a man who will become the navigator of wisdom.

316
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 Plato would rather say,

317
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 "The society we have described can never grow into a reality or see the light of day,

318
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,500
 and there will be no end to the troubles of the states."

319
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 Or indeed, my dear Glauken, of humanity itself,

320
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 till philosophers become rulers in this world,

321
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers,

322
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,500
 and political power and philosophy thus come into the same hands.

323
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
 There's just one issue with Plato's quote.

324
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 Every leader thinks they're a philosopher king.

325
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
 Everyone thinks their thoughts are the best.

326
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
 Everyone thinks their ideas are the wisest.

327
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
 From you, the great in China,

328
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 to the libreness of the Hittite Empire,

329
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,500
 to Siddhartha Gautama of the Kingdom of Maghada in India.

330
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 While not so far away in the Indian Kingdom of Maghada,

331
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
 a spoiled prince named Siddhartha Gautama, 500 BCE,

332
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
 lived in luxury inside a palace.

333
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,500
 Inside this palace, Siddhartha could have anything he wanted,

334
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
 all the jewels, all the wealth,

335
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,500
 all the finest goods thrust upon him.

336
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 His world inside of the palace was a utopia on Earth.

337
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,500
 There was no want, need or desire, and it was perfect.

338
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,500
 Until he went outside his palace compound, the only place he ever knew.

339
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,500
 As he took his first steps outside of his palace,

340
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
 what he saw struck a chord.

341
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 He saw an old man dying right on the street in front.

342
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
 He realized that the human experience

343
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,500
 wasn't something that was perfect and sublime.

344
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 Instead, it was death.

345
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 As Gilgamesh realized many years ago,

346
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,500
 this was an inevitable part of the human experience.

347
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 Siddhartha left his life of luxury behind and began a quest for knowledge and enlightenment.

348
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,500
 He studied with spiritual teachers and meditated for many years,

349
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
 searching for answers to life's big questions.

350
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,500
 Finally, after six years of seeking,

351
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,500
 he sat down under a fig tree and meditated until he achieved enlightenment.

352
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
 Enlightenment is a state of inner peace,

353
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,500
 in which one has transcended the limitations of the ego

354
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,500
 and is in touch with a universal consciousness or divine essence.

355
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
 It isn't a fixed and permanent thing,

356
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,500
 but rather an ongoing process of growth and development.

357
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
 But under that fig tree,

358
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,500
 Siddhartha became known as the Buddha, or the awakened one.

359
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,500
 He would spend the rest of his life traveling the countryside,

360
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
 becoming close to the enlightenment.

361
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:23,500
 Darius was determined to follow in his father's footsteps and take over the world.

362
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,500
 After finalizing their rule over the city state of Ionia,

363
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 the Persians were on a quest to take over Greece.

364
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,500
 Darius and his 20,000 men came to the city of Marathon in the year 490 BCE,

365
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 a city 26.2 miles away from Athens.

366
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,500
 The Athenians were vastly outnumbered, with only 10,000 men.

367
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
 As the Persians were trying to regroup,

368
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 the powerful Greek hoplites crushed the weaker Persian foot soldiers

369
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,500
 by routing the wings before turning towards the center of the Persian line.

370
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,500
 The remnants of the Persian army fled to their ships and left the battle.

371
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,500
 Early historians believed the battlefield littered 6,400 Persian bodies.

372
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,500
 While the Athenians lost only 192,

373
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
 so the Persians retreated,

374
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 and an Athenian messenger named Phytopides ran the 26.2 miles from Marathon to Athens.

375
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:26,500
 Exclaiming with joy how the Athenians just beat the mighty Persian Empire,

376
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,500
 all of Athens went crazy with this fantastic news.

377
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 Hence leading the Phytopides' historic trek to be sketched into history

378
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 as the world's first Marathon.

379
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
 However, the Persians weren't done,

380
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,500
 even with Darius I dying of mysterious circumstances.

381
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,500
 His son, Exersees I, took over the crown and wanted to complete his grandfather's legacy.

382
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,500
 In 480 BCE, Exersees I wanted revenge,

383
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 so he brought his enormous invasion force of over 100,000 soldiers,

384
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,500
 and was dead set on conquering Greece.

385
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,500
 Then at a narrow pass at Thermopylae, the Spartan king Leonidas had his force

386
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 of 7,000 Spartans maintain the defense.

387
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,500
 Leonidas knew of his disadvantage and developed a bold and daring plan to defeat the Persians,

388
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 rather than waiting for the Persians to attack.

389
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,500
 Leonidas ordered his soldiers to make a surprise attack on the Persian camp,

390
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,500
 catching the Persians off guard and disrupting their formation.

391
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 Despite their success, the Greek army was ultimately overwhelmed by the Persians,

392
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,500
 who attacked from all sides and eventually broke through the Greek defenses.

393
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,500
 Leonidas and his soldiers fought with courage and determination.

394
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,500
 Still, they were ultimately defeated.

395
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 Then came the Battle of Salamis, where the Greeks could change the tilt of the war

396
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:58,500
 in a naval battle between the 500 Persian Trirem and 300 Greek Trirem.

397
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
 It didn't look good for the Greeks.

398
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,500
 Still, the great Athenian general, the Mysticales,

399
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,500
 employed his plan to move the Persian fleet into the narrow straits of Salamis

400
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,500
 and hit the enemy fleet so hard that it had nowhere to retreat.

401
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,500
 After a massive sea battle, the Mysticales won Greece the victory

402
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
 and changed the face of the war.

403
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,500
 The Persians still had their goal, conquer the Greek city-states.

404
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,500
 Xerces had returned to Persia, leaving Persian general Mardonius

405
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,500
 in charge of the Persian force for most of the significant battle yet.

406
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,500
 After diplomatic talks ceased, Persian knew they had to attack.

407
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,500
 As the Persians sent their troops to Platea, the Greeks knew they had to work together.

408
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,500
 With 30 various Greek city-states working together,

409
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,500
 they were able to feel the massive 110,000 hoplite army

410
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,500
 with the primary purpose of defeating Persia.

411
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:00,500
 Though that was nothing compared to the estimated 150,000-man army of Persia.

412
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 The battle was fierce and intense.

413
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
 With both sides fighting with ferocity and determination,

414
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,500
 the Greek hoplites continued to be effective against the Persian cavalry and archers.

415
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,500
 The Greeks also strategically used the terrain,

416
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,500
 fighting on a slope that helped offset the Persian numerical advantage.

417
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,500
 In the end, the Greeks defeated the Persian forces and secured a decisive victory.

418
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,500
 The Persians suffered heavy losses, and Mardonius was killed in the fighting.

419
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
 The battle of Platea marked the end of the Greco-Persian Wars,

420
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,500
 and the Persian threat to Greece.

421
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,500
 After the Persian war, life in ancient Greece was spectacular.

422
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 A golden age of culture was upon us.

423
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 With no longer having to face the threat of war,

424
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,500
 Athens was able to create architectural wonders, such as the Parthenon.

425
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,500
 The Parthenon sits upon the Athenian Acropolis,

426
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,500
 a prominent hill overlooking the city of Athens, to show its wealth and culture.

427
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,500
 No matter where you'll go in Athens, you can still see the great Parthenon even today.

428
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
 Then came the theater.

429
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,500
 Around this time, the state would sponsor the most significant poets to create stories

430
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,500
 in the Athenian festival, called the City Dionysia,

431
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,500
 a festival designed to worship the Greek god of theater and fertility, Dionysus,

432
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,500
 creating playwrights such as Sophocles, Escalus, and Aristophanes.

433
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:38,500
 States were hungry for power.

434
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,500
 Athens was recruiting city states into their Delian alliance,

435
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,500
 while Sparta was recruiting city states into their Peloponnesian alliance.

436
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,500
 Both Sparta and Athens felt like they should control the city of Corkia,

437
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,500
 hence why in 434 BCE, war was upon the Greek peninsula,

438
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,500
 resulting in naval battles such as the Battle of Ciblos and the Battle of Pylos.

439
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,500
 By 421 BCE, a short piece was negotiated.

440
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,500
 However, this piece would not last, and Athens had their eyes on Sicily.

441
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,500
 Initially, the expedition was going well.

442
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,500
 The Athenians established alliances with several Sicilian cities,

443
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,500
 and one several minor skirmishes against the Sicilian forces.

444
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:29,500
 But soon, Alcibiades, one of the greatest naval generals in history,

445
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,500
 was recalled to Athens to face charges of sacrilege.

446
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,500
 The Athenian fleet was left without his leadership.

447
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:43,500
 In his absence, the expedition began to unravel.

448
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,500
 The Athenians could not take the city of Syracuse,

449
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,500
 which had fortified its defenses and was well prepared for a siege.

450
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,500
 The Sicilians were aided by reinforcements from Sparta,

451
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,500
 which saw an opportunity to strike a crippling blow against its arch-rival Athens.

452
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,500
 The Athenians suffered from a lack of supplies and were plagued by disease.

453
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,500
 At the same time, the Syracuseans launched a series of surprise attacks and ambushes.

454
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,500
 Finally, after months of grueling fighting,

455
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
 the Athenian fleet was destroyed in a decisive battle.

456
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,500
 Thousands of Athenians were killed, and many more were captured and enslaved.

457
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,500
 A decade after that, Athens fell to the Spartans.

458
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,500
 The age of legendary Greece was now over.

459
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,500
 Both Athens and Sparta were significantly weaker,

460
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,500
 never to regain the same power they once had,

461
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,500
 leaving the world ready for a philosopher king to conquer it all.

462
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:49,500
 Then, in the east, the mandate of Heaven was up.

463
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,500
 The Zhou dynasty, after a long, 800-year rule,

464
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,500
 it was deemed by the heavens that their empire was up,

465
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,500
 which led to a period known as the Warring States,

466
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,500
 474-221 BCE.

467
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,500
 This resulted in Han Fisie, who created a new philosophy called legalism.

468
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,500
 Followers of legalism believe that people were inherently selfish,

469
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,500
 and would only act in their own self-interest,

470
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,500
 and that the only way to keep them in line was through a system of rewards and punishments

471
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
 that was clear and consistently enforced.

472
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,500
 This resulted in Fisie claiming that the best way to achieve social order

473
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,500
 was by establishing a powerful ruler responsible for enforcing the law

474
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
 and punishing wrongdoers.

475
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,500
 He also believed the ruler should have complete control over the military,

476
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
 the economy, and society.

477
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:49,500
 While in the heart of the Oaxaca region of Mexico,

478
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,500
 the Zapitec civilization started to flourish.

479
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,500
 The capital city of Monte Albin was being built on a mountaintop

480
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
 overlooking the entire Oaxaca valley.

481
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,500
 Perched on the mountaintop overlooking the valley of Oaxaca,

482
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,500
 the city was home to a ruling elite who oversaw a hierarchical social structure

483
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,500
 that included middle-class artisans and lower-class farmers.

484
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:17,500
 The people of the Zapitec civilization were known for their innovative agricultural practices,

485
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,500
 including the cultivation of maize and other crops,

486
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,500
 which sustained their communities in times of drought and other environmental pressures.

487
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,500
 They also developed an early writing system, which used a combination of symbols and glyphs

488
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
 to represent words and ideas.

489
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:41,500
 They developed an advanced calendar system based on 260-day and 365-day solar cycles.

490
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:51,500
 In Greece, during the year 356 BCE, in the city of Pella in the Kingdom of Macedon,

491
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,500
 the greatest commander in history was born.

492
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,500
 Alexander the Great grew up knowing he would be a leader,

493
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,500
 and was the son of King Philip II in Queen Olympia,

494
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,500
 but the teacher was much more impressive.

495
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,500
 Since he was a kid, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle.

496
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,500
 Aristotle is the man who was known as the father of a logic.

497
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:21,500
 He created the fields of biology and taxonomy by introducing a way to think called the scientific method,

498
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,500
 a method that is still taught in schools to this day.

499
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,500
 He also wrote extensively about philosophy, ethics, and art,

500
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,500
 changing the face of the world as we know it today.

501
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,500
 This is the man who was in charge of teaching Alexander the Great.

502
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,500
 Alexander was 20 when his father was assassinated,

503
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,500
 but his excellent education allowed him to take over the rest of the world.

504
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:53,500
 After his father died in 336 BCE, Alexander was hellbent on keeping his family's power.

505
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,500
 So, in the Greek city of Thebes decided to revolt,

506
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,500
 Alexander and his army marched 240 miles in 14 days.

507
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,500
 When Thebes refused to surrender, he raised the entire city to the ground,

508
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,500
 6,000 were killed, and the rest were sold into slavery.

509
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
 The rest of the Greek city-states recoiled in fear,

510
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
 allowing Alexander to do as he pleased,

511
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:24,500
 leaving for his new target to be Persia and the new Persian king Darius III.

512
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:30,500
 In 333 BC, Alexander faced the Persian army at the Battle of Issus.

513
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,500
 This significant engagement saw the Persian king Darius III defeated and forced to flee.

514
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,500
 Alexander then captured several key cities, including the vital port of Tyre,

515
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
 which had resisted his initial siege.

516
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:50,500
 In 331 BC, Alexander faced Darius III again at the Battle of Gogamela,

517
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
 near the Tigris River in modern-day Iraq.

518
00:42:52,500 --> 00:43:00,500
 Despite being outnumbered, Alexander won a decisive victory using superior tactics in mobility.

519
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,500
 The Persian army was shattered, and Darius III fled once again.

520
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,500
 Alexander then proceeded to capture the Persian capital of Babylon,

521
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,500
 and took control of much of Mesopotamia.

522
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,500
 He continued his campaign eastward,

523
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,500
 winning battles in what is now modern-day Iran and Afghanistan.

524
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,500
 In 330 BC, he captured the Persian capital of Persepolis,

525
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,500
 a city of great wealth and cultural significance.

526
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
 But Alexander wasn't done.

527
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,500
 He wanted to expand eastward,

528
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,500
 eventually crossing the Hindu Kush Mountains into India.

529
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,500
 However, his troops grew tired of the endless fighting and refused to go any further,

530
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,500
 and Alexander was forced to turn back.

531
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:48,500
 However, after Alexander failed in the Indian subcontinent,

532
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,500
 a powerhouse emerged in India called the Mauryan Empire.

533
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:59,500
 At its height, it spanned over much of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.

534
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,500
 However, this conquering came at much of a cost for its leader Ashoka the Great.

535
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,500
 In 261 BC, after the death of his parents,

536
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,500
 Ashoka decided that his empire needed to expand.

537
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,500
 In his sights, the Kingdom of Kalinga, the war was bloody, the war was fierce.

538
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,500
 Over a hundred thousand people died.

539
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
 Ashoka couldn't sleep with himself.

540
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,500
 He didn't know how to deal with his actions that resulted in so much death,

541
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
 and returned to the teaching of the Buddha.

542
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:35,500
 Under Ashoka's rule, the Mauryan Empire became known for supporting Buddhist teachings

543
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
 and promoting non-violence.

544
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,500
 Ashoka issued a series of edicts inscribed on rocks and pillars throughout the empire

545
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,500
 that promoted principles such as kindness, respect for all religions,

546
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
 and the abolition of slavery.

547
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,500
 Certain traits were not shared in the west by Alexander.

548
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:02,500
 In the west, it was deemed honorable to die in combat,

549
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,500
 and a hero's death would be remembered forever.

550
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
 A farmer will die in anonymity.

551
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,500
 Alexander died a few years later in Babylon at the age of 32.

552
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:18,500
 Throughout his expedition, Alexander was spreading Greek ideas founded by his once-wise teacher,

553
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,500
 bringing the rise of Greek ideals across the land,

554
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,500
 starting the seeds of the western cultures we see today.

555
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,500
 Once Alexander died, his empire just could not sustain itself.

556
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,500
 His generals feuded as to who should be the leader of this great empire.

557
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,500
 Everyone wanted power, yet in fighting, left to waste and oblivion.

558
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,500
 Eventually, in 323 BC, after senseless wars,

559
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,500
 the Greek generals divided the world into three major empires.

560
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,500
 The Ptolemies in Egypt, the Solusids in the east, and the Antigonids in Greece.

561
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:01,500
 Ptolemies, one of Alexander's generals, led Egypt into a period of prosperity.

562
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:07,500
 Inspiration by his former leader, Ptolemies built the library of Alexandria,

563
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,500
 a hub for an intellectual scholarship.

564
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:16,500
 Intellectuals from all over will come to the library to exchange ideas and thoughts throughout the world,

565
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:23,500
 leaving us to have great philosophers like Plato and Aristotle to be the backbone of our culture.

566
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,500
 While the general "Soulucid" was given the keys to the city of Babylon,

567
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:34,500
 Babylon at this time was a cultural hub melting Greek, Persian, Indian, and Central Asian cultures.

568
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,500
 Solucid, though preferred Greek ideas and Greek language,

569
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,500
 the Solucid Empire was at its height during the reign of King Antiochus III,

570
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,500
 223 BC to 187 BC.

571
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:55,500
 Under King Antiochus III, the Solusids encompassed a vast territory from modern-day Turkey to modern-day Pakistan,

572
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:01,500
 one of the largest empires on record until the rise of the Romans.

573
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,500
 While the Antigonids did not have nearly as much success,

574
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,500
 by the time Antigonids I took power, the Greeks were just a shell of what they once were.

575
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:20,500
 The age of the Greeks was behind us, the Ptolemies, the Solucids, and the Antigonids went astray from the Roman Empire.

576
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:26,500
 However, for Rome to rise, it had to face a powerful foe, Carthage.

577
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:33,500
 Both Roman Carthage had a desire for the same city-state, Messina, on the island of Sicily.

578
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:38,500
 This would give either civilization a foothold to grab power in the Mediterranean.

579
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:46,500
 The first Punic War was upon us, and after 20 years of fighting in the year 241 BCE

580
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,500
 and the defeat of Carthage, the Treaty of Lutatius was signed.

581
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
 The peace, though, was sure to live.

582
00:47:53,500 --> 00:48:02,500
 In 218 BCE, the Second Punic Wars began when the Carthagin general Hannibal invaded Italy with his army,

583
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:11,500
 including elephants, to conquer Rome. Hannibal won several early battles, including the Battle of Keney in 216 BCE.

584
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:20,500
 Still, he was ultimately defeated by the Roman general Cipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama in 202 BCE.

585
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:27,500
 The war resulted in the complete defeat of Carthage, which was forced to seat its territories to Rome

586
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
 and the end of the Carthaginian Empire.

587
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:38,500
 There was no doubt in the world anymore that it was time for the Romans to take charge in the West.

588
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:48,500
 While in the East, after the end of the warring states period, Ching Shihuang and the Chindinisti were an absolute power.

589
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:57,500
 221 BCE to 206 BCE, Ching was determined to turn diverse China into a unified Chinese Empire.

590
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:06,500
 He divided the lands into 36 command areas, supervised by a governor, military commander, and imperial inspector.

591
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:12,500
 It was expected that he followed the will of Ching, or else you would face harsh penalties.

592
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:22,500
 The basic ideas of legalism in action, strong government, harsh laws, and inheriting knowing that humans were necessarily selfish.

593
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,500
 However, their mandate from heaven ran quite quickly.

594
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,500
 After Ching Shihuang's death, China was in turmoil with another dynasty on foot.

595
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:43,500
 Liu Bing, leader from 206 to 195 BCE, after leading a revolt against the Ching, was declared emperor of the new Han dynasty.

596
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:51,500
 Instead of following the strict legalistic mindset of the Ching, Liu decided to set his empire as a Confucianist paradise.

597
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:59,500
 The ideals of moderation, virtue, and purity, as set through Confucianism, were marched throughout the empire,

598
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,500
 weaving the cocoon of a powerful dynasty.

599
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:10,500
 During the Han dynasty, the production of silk was ever increasing, and the idea of profits was in the minds of all.

600
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:20,500
 So in 138 BCE, Emperor Han Wu sent an imperial convoy to make contact with cultures of Central Asia and the Mediterranean.

601
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:27,500
 Then, after the routes were established, Chinese merchants and traders would bring their silk across the Silk Road to the Middle East,

602
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:34,500
 and eventually Europe, where it would be sold at high profits, though in the beginning the route was relatively short.

603
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:42,500
 Because in 97 BC, Ambassador Khan Ying was sent to Rome with gifts of silk for their empire.

604
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:50,500
 However, Khan only got as far as Mesopotamia because he was told by the Parthians, the dominant empire in Iran at the time,

605
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,500
 that the journey would take years.

606
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:58,500
 Little did Khan know that he was misinformed, that the journey would have been relatively shorter,

607
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,500
 but the Parthians wanted to keep their spot as the middlemen.

608
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,500
 They did not want China and Rome to have contact with one another.

609
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,500
 Creating a system of three empires smushed right up against each other.

610
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,500
 Rome in the West, Parthians in the center, and China in the east.

611
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:30,500
 Then, in 86 BCE, Greece, already being weakened by the conquest of Alexander the Great, was now the target of the Roman Empire.

612
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:35,500
 General Lucius Cornelius Sola led an army of legions to the forefront of Athens.

613
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:41,500
 He besieged Athens for several months, brutally torturing the citizens within.

614
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,500
 Eventually, when Athens fell, he ordered his soldiers to loot and pillage the city,

615
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,500
 destroying many important cultural treasures.

616
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,500
 This takeover cemented Rome as a superpower.

617
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,500
 Athens no longer had the power, but rather it was in Rome.

618
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:05,500
 While in 63 BCE, General Pompeii was tasked with capturing Jerusalem and the region of Galilee.

619
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:11,500
 The Romans quickly captured the cities, forcing Galilee to be placed under Roman rule,

620
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,500
 including a small village called Nazareth.

621
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,500
 The Romans' desire to expand didn't end in Galilee though.

622
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:26,500
 In 58 BCE, Julius Caesar was appointed governor of the Roman provide of Sissipeline Gong,

623
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:31,500
 northern Italy, with the express assignment of conquering the rest of the Gauls.

624
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,500
 At the time, the Gauls were a group of Celtic peoples who lived in that area that is now France, Belgium,

625
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,500
 and parts of Switzerland, Germany, and Italy.

626
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,500
 However, it was Caesar's job to take over these Celtic tribes.

627
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:52,500
 While the Gauls, who were insistent on their independence, all had to work together under the leadership of Versen-Jeterix

628
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,500
 in a last ditch attempt to stop the Romans.

629
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:01,500
 As Caesar brought his troops to Alicia in 52 BC, war was upon us.

630
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:08,500
 Alicia was surrounded by a double wall and a ditch, with additional fortifications on the town's hills.

631
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,500
 Versen-Jeterix had gathered a large force of Gallic warriors inside the town.

632
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,500
 In contrast, Caesar had assembled a sizable Roman army outside the walls.

633
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,500
 Caesar realized that a direct assault on the town would be complex.

634
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,500
 So he surrounded the Gallic forces and starved them into submission.

635
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,500
 He ordered the construction of a series of fortifications around Alicia,

636
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,500
 including a circumvaluation wall that encircled the town,

637
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:41,500
 and a second wall and ditch that faced outward to defend against any attempts to break out.

638
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,500
 Over several weeks, Caesar's forces engaged in a grueling siege of Alicia,

639
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,500
 with both sides suffering heavy losses.

640
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,500
 The Gallic warriors inside the town made several attempts to break out,

641
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,500
 but they were repelled by the Roman forces.

642
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:03,500
 The tide of the battle turned in favor of the Romans when a second Gallic army, led by Versen-Jeterix's ally,

643
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,500
 Commius, attempted to relieve the siege.

644
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,500
 Caesar sent a detachment of his forces to intercept the Gallic reinforcements.

645
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,500
 After a fierce battle, the Roman soldiers emerged victorious.

646
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:21,500
 With his forces surrounded and facing starvation, Versen-Jeterix was forced to surrender.

647
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,500
 He emerged from Alicia and offered himself as a prisoner to Caesar,

648
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,500
 effectively ending the Gallic resistance to Roman rule.

649
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,500
 Throughout the next two years, Caesar crossed the Gallic Empire,

650
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
 conquering and implementing it in Jerome.

651
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:41,500
 The Gauls were implemented in Jerome, even gaining citizenship within the Empire.

652
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:48,500
 However, the Senate was not happy with Caesar.

653
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:53,500
 Even though he had great success against the Gauls, the Roman Senate wanted him to stop.

654
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,500
 They did not like the popularity Caesar was gaining,

655
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
 nor the power he was controlling.

656
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,500
 So the Roman Senate called upon Caesar to resign his command and disband his army,

657
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,500
 or risk being declared an enemy of the state.

658
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,500
 This led Caesar to an essential choice to make.

659
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,500
 Will he either follow the will of the Roman Senate,

660
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,500
 or ignore them and start a bloody civil war?

661
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:21,500
 Roman law at the time prohibited any general from crossing the Rubicon River,

662
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:27,500
 and entering mainland Italy with a standing army without the expressed permission of the Roman Senate.

663
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,500
 To do so would be treason,

664
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:35,500
 and this tiny stream would reveal Caesar's intentions and mark the point of no return.

665
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,500
 Civil war was imminent, as Caesar and his army marched over the Rubicon.

666
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:45,500
 Battles in Corphinium and Farsalis showed the Senate that Caesar was a worthy foe.

667
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,500
 So the Roman Senate appointed his son-in-law, Nius Pompey,

668
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,500
 to lead the Roman forces against his father-in-law.

669
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
 Both parties knew the importance of Spain,

670
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,500
 due to it providing a link between Italy and the rest of Europe.

671
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,500
 The two armies clashed near the town of Leda and northeastern Spain.

672
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,500
 Caesar's army was significantly outnumbered,

673
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:12,500
 but he could use his superior military tactics and training to gain the upper hand in the battle.

674
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:17,500
 After several days of intense fighting, Caesar emerged victorious,

675
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,500
 forcing Pompey's forces to retreat,

676
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,500
 declaring Caesar as the new leader of Rome.

677
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:29,500
 When Caesar made it back to Rome, the crowds were chanting "Hail Caesar, Hail Caesar!"

678
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,500
 The people then decided that he would be the dictator of Rome for life.

679
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,500
 Caesar immediately set to work,

680
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:41,500
 implementing a series of reforms and policies aimed at improving ordinary Roman's lives,

681
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,500
 and strengthening the central government's power.

682
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:49,500
 He ordered the construction of new infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and aqueducts,

683
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,500
 which helped to connect different parts of the city and improve trade and commerce.

684
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,500
 Caesar also enacted a series of political and social reforms,

685
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,500
 including granting citizenship to many people living in the Roman Empire

686
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,500
 and creating new laws and customs that were based on Roman practices.

687
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,500
 He encouraged the spread of the Latin language and culture throughout the city,

688
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:18,500
 and established the Julian calendar, which is the basis of the calendar we use today.

689
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:25,500
 However, Caesar's reign was short-lived, because two years later, in 44 BC,

690
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:31,500
 he was stabbed to death by two loyal senators, Cassius and Brutus.

691
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,500
 The assassination of Caesar led the Roman world into disarray.

692
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:41,500
 The world was filled with factions, vying for government control without a strong leader.

693
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:46,500
 Octavian Caesar's son, who was 18 then,

694
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:51,500
 came to Rome to claim his inheritance and assert his place in the political landscape.

695
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,500
 He quickly aligned himself with Caesar's loyal lieutenant, Mark Antony.

696
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:01,500
 Together, they defeated Caesar's assassins at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BCE.

697
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,500
 However, tensions soon arose between Octavian and Antony,

698
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,500
 as both men vied for control of the Roman Empire.

699
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:13,500
 In 31 BCE, their forces clashed in the naval battle of Actium,

700
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,500
 which resulted in Octavian emerging as the clear victor.

701
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,500
 Antony fled to Egypt with his lover, Cleopatra,

702
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,500
 and the two committed suicide the following year.

703
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:29,500
 With Antony's defeat, Octavian emerged as the undisputed ruler of Rome.

704
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:35,500
 In 27 BCE, he was appointed Augustus and became the first Roman emperor.

705
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:49,500
 During Augustus's reign, a man who had changed the world was born in the Roman-occupied city of Bethlehem, Jesus Christ.

706
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:56,500
 The Gospel of Luke says, "In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered."

707
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,500
 This was the first registration when Corinius was governor of Syria,

708
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:06,500
 and all went to be registered, each to his own town, Luke 2, 1 through 3.

709
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,500
 This census was an essential factor in Roman society,

710
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:13,500
 because it established the population counts in these various communities,

711
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,500
 making it possible to tax these various citizens.

712
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,500
 So the highly pregnant Mary and her betrothed husband, Joseph,

713
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:25,500
 had to travel 90 miles on foot from Nazareth to Bethlehem,

714
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,500
 to complete this legally required Roman census.

715
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,500
 When they arrived in Bethlehem, many other descendants of the King of David,

716
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:38,500
 or members of the Jewish faith, were also going to Bethlehem for the census.

717
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,500
 They found out that there was no room for them in the inn,

718
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:46,500
 so they were forced to take shelter in a stable where Mary gave birth to Jesus.

719
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,500
 Jesus was later named "King of the Jews."

720
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,500
 After Jesus' birthday and the completion of the census,

721
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,500
 Mary and Joseph returned in Nazareth with their extraordinary son.

722
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,500
 As the years of Jesus went on, stories about him grew.

723
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,500
 More and more followers began to worship Jesus as their Messiah.

724
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,500
 They claimed that he can catch an endless amount of fish.

725
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:13,500
 They claimed that he can cure the blind, and they claimed that he was the Son of God.

726
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:19,500
 So these followers, specifically his disciples, started to write down his entire life journey.

727
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:24,500
 Four of his closest disciples, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

728
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,500
 wrote down the main chunks of the book in these parts called "Gospels."

729
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,500
 Each of these Gospels covered almost all of the same events,

730
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,500
 the narrative life of Jesus Christ.

731
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:43,500
 This narrative testimony of a child born in a stable changed the world forever.

732
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:48,500
 Even though many loved Jesus, some viewed him as a threat.

733
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:54,500
 Emperor Tiberius succeeded Augustus and reigned from 14 AD to 37 AD.

734
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,500
 Tiberius was notorious for his "delatores."

735
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:03,500
 A network of informants rewarded for spying and reporting on suspected traitors and criminals.

736
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,500
 Criminals reported on by the "delatores" had to face a treason trial,

737
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,500
 often resulting in executions or forced suicides.

738
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:19,500
 His prefect of Judea at the time, Pontius Pilate, was no stranger to the harsh punishment of traitors.

739
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,500
 As Jesus was influencing more and more people, he became more of a political threat.

740
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,500
 So, following the guidelines of Emperor Tiberius,

741
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:35,500
 Pilate was given no practical political choice other than to execute Jesus on the cross.

742
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,500
 Roman law was evident then.

743
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,500
 One must follow the Emperor's will or else they will perish.

744
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:46,500
 As Jesus was crucified on the cross, a new religion was born.

745
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
 Christianity.

746
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,500
 In the beginning, Christianity was just a small sect of Judaism.

747
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,500
 Nevertheless, its growth would be unparalleled.

748
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,500
 Paul of Taurus would take the word of his chosen lord across the known world.

749
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,500
 From Greece to Turkey to Syria, the word of Jesus Christ spread.

750
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,500
 His missionary tales are now documented in the New Testament as the Book of Acts.

751
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:17,500
 The more Paul went to different places, the more followers he gained.

752
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,500
 On the same token, it created more enemies.

753
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,500
 The divide between monotheism and polytheism was on the rise.

754
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:29,500
 It was beginning to get a lot tougher for Romans to accept a religious population

755
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,500
 that didn't believe in gods like Mars and Jupiter.

756
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,500
 So, when the Great Fire of Rome occurred in July of 64 AD,

757
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:41,500
 Emperor Nero quickly blamed it on the Christians.

758
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,500
 The Great Fire was an event that destroyed two-thirds of the city of Rome.

759
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,500
 So, in order to pay for these massive repairs,

760
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,500
 Nero instituted heavy tributes across the empire.

761
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,500
 To meet at least a proportion of the costs,

762
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,500
 Nero also started to print more Roman currency,

763
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:04,500
 creating an inflationary effect for the first time in the empire's history.

764
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:09,500
 However, the individuals who lived under Roman rule, which wasn't in Rome proper,

765
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,500
 were upset by this new policy.

766
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:17,500
 So, in the holy city of Jerusalem in 66 AD, a revolt was on.

767
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,500
 At first, the first Jewish revolt succeeded,

768
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,500
 and the Jewish forces quickly expelled the unprepared Roman army.

769
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,500
 Then, the rebels gained some traction in the neighboring villages in Galilee.

770
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:35,500
 In response, the Roman Emperor Nero sent the general Vespasian to meet the Jewish forces,

771
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:40,500
 an endeavor that pushed most rebels into Jerusalem proper,

772
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,500
 by the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in 69 CE.

773
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:51,500
 Then, around Passover in 70 AD, Vespasian and his forces sieged the city,

774
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:55,500
 depleting it of food and water within the walls of Jerusalem.

775
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:00,500
 The Jews started to quarrel within, leaving them more vulnerable to attack.

776
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,500
 By August, the Romans breached the defenses,

777
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,500
 killed much of the population, and destroyed many of their holy sites.

778
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:14,500
 With the Jews decimated, the strength of polytheism lived long.

779
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:20,500
 Then, in 98-117 AD, under Emperor Trejan,

780
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:25,500
 the Roman Empire was able to expand its greatest territorial extent,

781
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:30,500
 spanning all the way from modern day Britain to the Persian Gulf.

782
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,500
 Roman rule was everywhere.

783
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:38,500
 Well, except for in the Americas, because the Romans didn't even know they existed.

784
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:43,500
 In the Americas, we can see the growth of various civilizations across the Andes,

785
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,500
 located in modern day Peru in Chile.

786
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:51,500
 The Mochi civilization was able to build monumental structures,

787
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,500
 like the Wacadell soul and Wacadellaluna,

788
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,500
 impressive pyramids that were the center of their religions.

789
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:04,500
 They also created advanced fertilization techniques that used bird droppings as fertilizer.

790
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:10,500
 Their highly centralized government made everyone know their place in society.

791
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:16,500
 While a little bit more south, the Nazca civilization is one enthralled in mystery.

792
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,500
 The people of Nazca created a series of large-scale geoglyph,

793
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,500
 consisting of hundreds of individual figures, including geometric shapes,

794
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,500
 animals and human-like figures, by removing the dark reddish-brown,

795
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,500
 iron oxide-coated pebbles, covering the surface of the Nazca desert.

796
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,500
 These lines are now called Nazca lines,

797
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:45,500
 the purpose of which is still unknown to this day and subject to conspiracy theory today.

798
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:51,500
 Around 100 AD, the Zapotec started establishing Monty Albin, their capital.

799
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,500
 It was one of the first examples of urban planning in the Americas.

800
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,500
 The city was laid out in a grid pattern, with main roads and smaller side streets

801
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,500
 leading to plazas and public buildings.

802
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:07,500
 The city was also divided into different districts, each with specialized functions,

803
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:11,500
 such as residential, administrative and religious,

804
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,500
 leaving it to be in use for a thousand years after that.

805
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:26,500
 While back in Rome, after the end of Trajan's reign in 117 AD,

806
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,500
 a new emperor with a purpose was in hand.

807
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,500
 Hadrian was a man tasked with a near-impossible,

808
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,500
 keeping the massive Roman Empire under one rule.

809
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:40,500
 He first had to deal with a crisis with the newly colonized Roman Britain.

810
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:45,500
 Like their predecessors in Judea, the Roman Brits did not like being Roman,

811
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,500
 so they started to cause unrest, and in the eyes of Hadrian,

812
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:53,500
 a real threat of revolution was on his mind.

813
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:57,500
 So Hadrian had ordered a massive wall, aptly named Hadrian's Wall,

814
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,500
 which spanned almost coast to coast,

815
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,500
 keeping it sunk in the conquered people's minds that the Romans were here,

816
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,500
 staving off revolution in one region.

817
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,500
 However, in Galilee, things weren't as peaceful.

818
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:17,500
 Simon Bar-Cocca led a rebellion of the Jewish people to free themselves from Roman rule.

819
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:24,500
 As you see, Rome was developing a new city called "Alia Capitolina" over the ruins of Jerusalem.

820
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,500
 From the last revolt with temples, dedicated to polytheistic gods like Jupiter.

821
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:34,500
 By 132 Bar-Cocca took the bottle of nasi, head of state.

822
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:40,500
 Many Jews regarded him as the Messiah, who would save the Jewish people and restore their independence.

823
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,500
 Cocpa's troops would storm "Alia Capitolina",

824
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,500
 almost knocking out entirely the Roman garrison controlling the city.

825
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,500
 Hadrian, though, would not have it.

826
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:55,500
 So he sent a force of 120,000 men to the lands of Judea

827
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:59,500
 to conquer and force the Jewish people into submission.

828
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,500
 As Cassius Dio says in the history of Rome,

829
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,500
 "Fifty of their most important outposts,

830
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,500
 and 985 of their most famous villages were raised.

831
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:15,500
 580,000 men were slain in the various raids and battles."

832
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:21,500
 And the number of those that perished by famine, disease and fire was passed finding out.

833
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,500
 Thus, nearly the whole of Judea was made desolate.

834
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,500
 History of Rome, 69.14, 1-2.

835
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,500
 Rome made it clear that it was not to be taken lightly.

836
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:38,500
 While in China, the message was quite different.

837
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,500
 The ideas of Buddhism were spreading,

838
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:45,500
 along with the Chinese philosophies of Confucianism and Taoism,

839
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,500
 and built a dynasty.

840
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:53,500
 These three philosophies worked together to make the Han dynasty stronger and more united in many ways.

841
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:58,500
 While in America, the Mayan architects went across northern Petten

842
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:03,500
 and designed a series of short, broad temples with wide staircases

843
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
 flanked by enormous stucco masks.

844
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,500
 These stucco masks were made of plaster,

845
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,500
 and some burned and powdered limestone.

846
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,500
 The Mayans built these stone armatures into elaborate deity faces

847
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,500
 to capture the soul of the gods and bring it to the people.

848
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,500
 A temple like the E7 sub,

849
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,500
 yes historians named Mayan temples like military submarines,

850
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,500
 is a pyramid with 16 stucco masks.

851
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,500
 Each allows us to go deeper into the souls of these deities of the past.

852
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,500
 In the Middle East, a new empire was emerging with roots in the past.

853
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:46,500
 A man named Artesheer claimed to have a royal blood that traced all the way back to Cyrus the Great.

854
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:51,500
 Artesheer claimed that he should be the true ruler of the Persian Empire,

855
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,500
 not those frauds of the Parthians.

856
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,500
 Artesheer was able to unite the various tribes of Persia.

857
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:04,500
 In 224 AD, Artesheer I led his forces against the party and king, Artabenus V,

858
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,500
 in a significant battle at Hermazgum.

859
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:12,500
 The Sasanian forces, known for their cavalry, defeated the Parthians

860
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,500
 and captured Artabenus V.

861
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:21,500
 With this victory, Artesheer I declared himself king and established the Sasanian Empire.

862
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,500
 Artesheer I quickly established a centralized government

863
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:29,500
 and built a new capital at Tijifan on the Tigris River.

864
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:34,500
 He reestablished the Zoro-Aestrian religion, which had been suppressed by the Parthians

865
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,500
 as the empire's official religion.

866
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:42,500
 He also built a powerful military machine with skilled cavalry and archers.

867
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:47,500
 He began to expand his territory by conquering neighboring regions.

868
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:53,500
 As the Parthians were on their way out, so were the Han.

869
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:59,500
 The Han Dynasty's downfall was marked by political instability, economic problems,

870
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:04,500
 external threats, internal rebellions, and power struggles.

871
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,500
 The weakening of central authority allowed regional warlords to seize power,

872
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,500
 and the government's attempts to address economic issues were unsuccessful.

873
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:18,500
 External threats and rebellions weakened the dynasty even further.

874
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:24,500
 The warlord named São P declared himself emperor and established the Wei dynasty,

875
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,500
 officially ending the Han dynasty.

876
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:38,500
 While back in Rome, emperor Diocletian, 284-305 faced a problem.

877
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,500
 Rome was becoming too large and impossible to manage.

878
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,500
 So, Diocletian created the Tetra Key and divided the region into four,

879
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,500
 and the region was governed by a separate emperor.

880
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:55,500
 Within the Tetra Key, there were two types of emperors, Augustus and Caesars.

881
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:00,500
 Diocletian chose Maximian to be his equal to Augustus.

882
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:05,500
 In contrast, Gallerus and Constantius were appointed to be Caesars.

883
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:10,500
 However, this system created uncontrolled chaos and anarchy.

884
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,500
 Each emperor had desires for power and ambition,

885
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,500
 but all came to a head in 305 when power shifted.

886
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:23,500
 Both Diocletian and Maximian retired, and in 306, Constantius died.

887
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:28,500
 Three out of the four original leaders were left out of the system,

888
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,500
 leading to a power vacuum to come.

889
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,500
 Emperor Constantine the Great was appointed by his father's army unilaterally,

890
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:40,500
 as an Augustus and a Caesar at the same time to replace his father.

891
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:46,500
 At the same time, Maximian's son Maxentius felt as though he should have been appointed Caesar

892
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,500
 instead of Valerius Severus.

893
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:55,500
 So, in 307, Maxentius sent his army and forced Valerius Severus to surrender.

894
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,500
 Come 308, Gallerus appointed Licinius to replace him.

895
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,500
 So, on the west side of Rome, two emperors wanted to rule.

896
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:10,500
 Constantine ruled over Gaul in Britain, and Maxentius ruled Italy and North Africa.

897
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,500
 Maxentius had a difficult time consolidating his power,

898
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:18,500
 and he faced increasing resistance from the people of Rome.

899
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:24,500
 To try and secure his hold on power, Maxentius ordered the construction of a new bridge

900
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:29,500
 across the Tiber River near Rome, known as the Milvian Bridge.

901
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:36,500
 Constantine saw Maxentius as a threat to his power, so he decided to march on Rome to confront him.

902
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:43,500
 As the two armies approached each other near the Milvian Bridge, Constantine had a vision of a cross in the sky.

903
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:50,500
 With the words "in this sign, conquer," some accounts suggest that this vision may have been a dream or a hallucination.

904
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:56,500
 While others suggest that it may have been a sign from God, regardless of the nature of the vision,

905
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:03,500
 Maxentius took it as a sign that he would be victorious in battle if he fought under the sign of the Christian cross.

906
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:10,500
 He had his soldiers paint this symbol on their shields and banners, and he went into battle with renewed vigor and confidence.

907
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,500
 The battle was fierce and brutal, with both sides suffering heavy losses.

908
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:20,500
 Maxentius had a larger army, but his troops were spread out and disorganized.

909
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:27,500
 He was able to take advantage of this, and he was able to push Maxentius' forces back towards the Tiber River.

910
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:33,500
 In the chaos of the retreat, Maxentius was forced off the Milvian Bridge and into the water, where he drowned.

911
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:45,500
 Shortly after his victory, Constantine met Licinius at Midiolanum, modern Milan, to confirm several political and dynastic arrangements to produce the Edict of Milan.

912
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:52,500
 The Edict gave power for Eastern Rome to Licinius and Constantine's soul power of the West.

913
01:14:52,500 --> 01:15:02,500
 More importantly though, this document extended religious tolerance for Christians, and restored any properties confiscated from them during the persecution.

914
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:06,500
 However, the peaceful coexistence of both rulers was short-lived.

915
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:13,500
 Though the Edict allowed for the safety of Christians, Licinius was still very much a paganist.

916
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,500
 The forces started to grow.

917
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:21,500
 All came near the city of Chrysopolis in 324 AD, where both armies went and fought.

918
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,500
 Constantine's military might was on display.

919
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:31,500
 He was able to force the Eastern Roman army towards the sea, leaving many to be killed or captured.

920
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:37,500
 Constantine was declared the sole leader of Rome, and Licinius was declared dead by hanging.

921
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:44,500
 He renamed the Eastern Roman capital from Byzantium to Constantinople to celebrate his victory.

922
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:49,500
 Then in 325 AD, Constantine presided over the First Council of Nicaea.

923
01:15:49,500 --> 01:16:01,500
 When the 300 bishops established the now famous Nicene Creed, which declared that Jesus Christ was begotten, not made, and of one substance with the Father.

924
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:08,500
 Constantine was finally baptized as a Christian on his deathbed in 337 AD.

925
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:18,500
 Come 370 AD, a new player was on the scenes.

926
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:25,500
 The Huns were a barbaric nomadic civilization who were masters of warfare.

927
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:30,500
 According to legends, they were taught horsemanship as early as the age of three.

928
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:34,500
 Also, they would attack their own with a sword to teach them how to endure pain.

929
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,500
 These people weren't to be messed lightly with.

930
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:42,500
 When they crossed the Volga River in 370 on their horses and lost it for blood,

931
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,500
 the Allen's civilization didn't stand much chance.

932
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:51,500
 Two years later, they attacked the Austro-Goths, an Eastern tribe of Germanic Goths

933
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,500
 who harassed the Roman Empire by frequently attacking their territories.

934
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:01,500
 By 376, the Huns had attacked the Visigoths, the Western tribe of Goths,

935
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,500
 and forced them to seek sanctuary within the Roman Empire.

936
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:15,500
 As the Huns dominated Goth and Visigoth lands, they earned a new reputation as the new barbarians in town, and seemed unstoppable.

937
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:25,500
 By 395 AD, they began invading Roman domains, and some Roman Christians believed they were devils who arrived straight from hell.

938
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:31,500
 The reason they started invading Rome was because of the death of Theodosius the Great.

939
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:36,500
 His shining achievement as Emperor was keeping the Goths in the Huns at bay.

940
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:42,500
 But on death, he decided to follow the ideas of Diocletian and split the Empire up again,

941
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:49,500
 splitting up control between his two sons, Arcadius in the East, and Honorius in the West,

942
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:55,500
 making Theodosius the last leader of a united Rome.

943
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:01,500
 With Honorius in charge, the incapable general made Western Rome an easy target to be bullied.

944
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:06,500
 The Visigoths, looking for a new place to live, had their eyes set on Rome,

945
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:12,500
 so throughout the early 410s, the Visigoths ransacked various Roman cities.

946
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:20,500
 Then, on August 24, 410, the Visigoths sacked Rome, taking control of this historic city.

947
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:26,500
 It was the first time in nearly 800 years that a foreign army occupied the city of Rome.

948
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:30,500
 However, the Visigoths couldn't maintain control of Rome.

949
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:40,500
 Instead, they continued to ransack Roman territories until they established their kingdom in 418 in modern-day Spain.

950
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:45,500
 While the prospects of existence weren't so much better in Eastern Rome,

951
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,500
 the notorious Attila the Hun was gaining power,

952
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,500
 and his brutal tactics called him the "Scorge of God".

953
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:59,500
 After a failed peace attempt in 441, Attila and his armies stormed through the Balkans and the Danaben frontier.

954
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:07,500
 Another peace treaty was forged in 442, but Attila attacked again in 443, killing, ransacking,

955
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:12,500
 and pillaging his way to the well-fortified city of Constantinople.

956
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,500
 However, due to Constantinople's high walls, Attila couldn't conquer it.

957
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,500
 Instead, Attila was able to muster another peace agreement.

958
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:28,500
 He would leave Constantinople alone, in exchange for an annual tribute of 2,100 pounds of gold.

959
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,500
 A staggering sum.

960
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:37,500
 Then, in 451, the Huns invaded the Gauls, allowing the once enemies of the Visigoths

961
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,500
 and the Romans to wise up and work together to fight the Huns.

962
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:47,500
 According to legend, the night before the imminent battle, Attila consulted sacrificed bones

963
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:51,500
 and saw that thousands of his army would fall in the fight.

964
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,500
 The next day, his premonition came true.

965
01:19:54,500 --> 01:20:02,500
 In the Battle of the Catalonian Plains, after hours of ferocious fighting, tens of thousands of soldiers lay dead,

966
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:07,500
 giving Attila his first and only military defeat in history.

967
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:15,500
 However, even after the loss, Attila and his army marched on and returned to Italy, continuously ravaging the cities.

968
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:23,500
 In 452, with Roman sight, he met Pope Leo I, who acted as an emissary between Attila and Rome.

969
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,500
 There's no record of what they discussed.

970
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:31,500
 Still, according to legend, the apparitions of Saint Paul and Saint Peter appeared to Attila.

971
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:36,500
 They threatened to kill him if he didn't negotiate with Pope Leo I.

972
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:41,500
 Attila decided to pull out of Italy in return to the Great Hungarian Plain,

973
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:45,500
 whether because of his fear of the Pope and his saintly allies,

974
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:51,500
 or because of his troops were stretched too thin and weakened by malaria.

975
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:55,500
 However, the struggle for Western Rome wasn't over.

976
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:02,500
 In 476 AD, the young Emperor Romulus Augustus had trouble keeping power for himself,

977
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,500
 as many Romans felt he was illegitimate.

978
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:09,500
 So the Eastern Roman Empire sent the Germanic general, Odeusir,

979
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:14,500
 and his mercenaries to suppress a revolt by the Roman army in the region.

980
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,500
 However, instead of supporting the Eastern Roman Empire,

981
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:21,500
 Odeusir saw an opportunity to seize power for himself.

982
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:28,500
 He turned against the Roman government and opposed the last Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustus,

983
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:33,500
 effectively marking the end of the Western Roman Empire.

984
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:37,500
 As the steps of his victory, Odeusir was declared the King of Italy.

985
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:42,500
 However, Odeusir's victory was short-lived, because in 493,

986
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:48,500
 theodoric the Great of the Ostrogoths, with the support of Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno,

987
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:52,500
 came in and created the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy,

988
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,500
 sending Odeusir to meet his fate.

989
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:01,500
 While Europe was in the crux of a dark age,

990
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,500
 India, under the Gupta Empire, was in a mathematical golden age.

991
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:11,500
 Great mathematicians like Brahma Gupta started using zero as a placeholder,

992
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:15,500
 and as various solutions for mathematical equations.

993
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:20,500
 The astronomer Aribada was able to calculate the circumference of the Earth.

994
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:24,500
 He proved the world was round long before it was globally accepted.

995
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:30,500
 Aribada was also able to develop methods for calculating pie and square roots.

996
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:35,500
 However, his crowning achievement was creating the concept of an asymptote,

997
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:40,500
 which is a line that approaches the curve but never touches it.

998
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:45,500
 The Franks under Clovis I had been engaged with the Alamani,

999
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:51,500
 another Germanic tribe, and tensions between the two groups were running high.

1000
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,500
 In 496 AD, in the Battle of Tolbeic,

1001
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:58,500
 Clovis I led his forces into battle against the Alamani,

1002
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:05,500
 with both sides eager to gain the upper hand in the ongoing struggle for power and territory.

1003
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,500
 As the Alamani began to push the Franks to defeat,

1004
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:14,500
 in a moment of desperation, Clovis called out to the Christian God for assistance,

1005
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,500
 promising to convert to Christianity if he emerged victorious.

1006
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:22,500
 According to legend, a sudden thunderstorm appeared,

1007
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:27,500
 and the Franks could regroup and launch a successful counterattack against the Alamani.

1008
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:31,500
 The battle ended in a decisive victory for the Franks,

1009
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,500
 and Clovis kept his promise and converted to Christianity.

1010
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:38,500
 Officially cementing Christianity to the forefront,

1011
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:42,500
 and birthing the Frankish Kingdom.

1012
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,500
 While the Western Roman Empire might have fallen in the East,

1013
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,500
 the Roman Empire was changing.

1014
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,500
 Many historians argue that the Eastern Roman Empire,

1015
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:55,500
 based out of Constantinople, should be considered a part of Rome.

1016
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:59,500
 However, it is undeniable that under Justinian I,

1017
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,500
 would lead the Eastern half into its next chapter in life.

1018
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,500
 The Byzantine Empire.

1019
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,500
 Whether it's a continuation of the Roman Empire before,

1020
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,500
 is a debate for another under.

1021
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,500
 Under the leadership of Justinian I,

1022
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,500
 like many Roman emperors before him,

1023
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:20,500
 he would expand the Byzantine Empire to reach places such as Italy,

1024
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,500
 North Africa, and even Spain.

1025
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:29,500
 He also commissioned a team of legal scholars to codify all the laws of the Roman Empire,

1026
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:32,500
 known as the Corpus Juris Civilis,

1027
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:37,500
 which became the basis of the European laws we know today.

1028
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:42,500
 He also commissioned the world-renowned Hagia Sophia in Constantinople,

1029
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,500
 where this beautiful cathedral,

1030
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:48,500
 adorned with intricate mosaics and marble decorations,

1031
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,500
 became the head of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

1032
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,500
 However, Jesus wasn't the only prophet at the time.

1033
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,500
 In the small town of Mecca,

1034
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:07,500
 a nomadic tribe called the Khorash gave birth to a man

1035
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:11,500
 who would change the religious world yet again, Muhammad.

1036
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,500
 Muhammad was orphaned at an early age,

1037
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,500
 and was raised by his grandfather and later his uncle.

1038
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,500
 As he grew up, he worked as a merchant,

1039
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,500
 which earned him the nickname Al-Amin,

1040
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:24,500
 meaning "the trustworthy".

1041
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,500
 On one of his pilgrimages in 610,

1042
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,500
 Muhammad meditated in a cave on Mount Jabbalah,

1043
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:35,500
 nor the angel Gabriel appeared and relayed the word of God.

1044
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,500
 Resight in the name of your Lord, who creates,

1045
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,500
 creates a man from a clot.

1046
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,500
 Resight for your Lord is most generous,

1047
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,500
 became the opening verses of Surah,

1048
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,500
 chapter 96 of the Quran.

1049
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,500
 At first, Muhammad was reluctant,

1050
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,500
 not knowing how to disclose this information.

1051
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
 However, soon enough,

1052
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,500
 Muhammad began to gather a small following,

1053
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,500
 which was mocked by the pagans of Mecca.

1054
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,500
 However, when Muhammad denounced idol worship,

1055
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,500
 the leader of Mecca knew that he was through.

1056
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,500
 So, through the resistance from Mecca,

1057
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:12,500
 Muhammad and his followers were eventually forced to emigrate to Medina,

1058
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:16,500
 a city 260 miles away.

1059
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:20,500
 There, Muhammad was instrumental in ending various civil wars,

1060
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:24,500
 creating a prosperous Muslim community.

1061
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:29,500
 Nevertheless, this prosperity would be challenged by the members of Muhammad's old tribe,

1062
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,500
 the Quraysh and their allies,

1063
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:36,500
 who marched up to Medina with a large army to attack the Muslims.

1064
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,500
 Muhammad devised a plan that they could defend the city

1065
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,500
 if they dug a trench around its perimeter,

1066
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:46,500
 making it near impossible for enemy forces to penetrate.

1067
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:49,500
 For several weeks, the Quraysh tried to break through the trench,

1068
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,500
 trying and trying yet again.

1069
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:57,500
 Eventually, strong wind and heavy rained caused the Quraysh forces to abandon the siege,

1070
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,500
 marking the Muslims as victorious.

1071
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,500
 In 630, the Muslim army marched into Mecca,

1072
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:07,500
 taking the city with minimum casualties.

1073
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:11,500
 Muhammad gave amnesty to the enemy leaders who once opposed him,

1074
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:16,500
 converting most of the Mecca population to Islam.

1075
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:22,500
 At the time of Muhammad's death, the Muslims had successfully united the Arabian Peninsula

1076
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,500
 under the banner of Islam.

1077
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:30,500
 After Muhammad's death, a series of caliphs or leaders took over the leadership of the Muslim community.

1078
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:35,500
 Beginning with Abu Bakr, a close companion of the prophet,

1079
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:40,500
 under the leadership of the caliphs, the Muslim community continued to expand its territory,

1080
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,500
 conquering new lands and spreading the message of Islam.

1081
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:50,500
 At first, Akubakar had his eyes set on the Byzantine Empire's provinces of Syria,

1082
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:54,500
 taking over the crucial cities of Damascus and Jerusalem.

1083
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:59,500
 Then, in 636, the Arab forces invaded the Sassanid Empire,

1084
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:05,500
 taking over their capital city in 637, marking the end of the Sassanid Empire.

1085
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:09,500
 Onward to Egypt, they went, where, after years of fighting,

1086
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:16,500
 they successfully defeated the Byzantine to take over the city of Alexandria in 642 AD,

1087
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,500
 economically crippling the Byzantines.

1088
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:24,500
 By 716, the Arab forces had conquered much of North Africa,

1089
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:34,500
 Carthage and Spain, so that by 716, the Arabs had an extensive empire from Lisbon to China.

1090
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,500
 After consolidating their hold on the Iberian Peninsula,

1091
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:43,500
 the Arabs launched raids into neighboring Francia, modern-day France.

1092
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:49,500
 In 732 AD, they launched a significant invasion to expand their territory northward.

1093
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:53,500
 The Arabs' forces led by a mere Abdul Rahman al-Gafiki,

1094
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:58,500
 quickly conquered several cities in the region, including Bordeaux and Tours.

1095
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,500
 However, Charles Martell, the military leader of the Franks,

1096
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,500
 assembled a large army to meet the Arabs in battle,

1097
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,500
 the Battle of Christianity versus Islam.

1098
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:11,500
 Both empires wanted to keep their own faith,

1099
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:15,500
 the Arabs wanted to impose their religion onto the Franks.

1100
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:21,500
 The two forces clashed near tours on October 10th, 732 AD.

1101
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,500
 The battle was fierce and lasted several days,

1102
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,500
 with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

1103
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:31,500
 In the end, though, Charles Martell and the Franks emerged victorious,

1104
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,500
 and the Arab forces were forced to retreat back to Spain,

1105
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:39,500
 ending the massive expansion of the Arabic Empire.

1106
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:49,500
 While in the West, the definition of God was war.

1107
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,500
 In China, during the rule of the Tang,

1108
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,500
 religions like Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism all co-existed peacefully.

1109
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,500
 A citizen was able to believe what they wanted to believe,

1110
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:05,500
 leaving for many temples and pagodas to be built across the empire.

1111
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:10,500
 Also, during the Tang, the height of Chinese poetry was upon us.

1112
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:17,500
 Poets like Lipo and Du Fu created poems that later became the foundations of Chinese literature.

1113
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:22,500
 Lipo wrote a poignant poem called "Zanzen on the Qing Thing Mountain",

1114
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,500
 translated by Sam Hamill.

1115
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:29,500
 The birds have vanished down the sky, now the last cloud drains away.

1116
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:34,500
 We sit together the mountain in me until only the mountain remains.

1117
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:42,500
 Charlemagne, also known as Charles the Great, became the king of the Franks in 768.

1118
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:49,500
 Charlemagne was a skilled military leader who expanded the Frankish Empire through successful campaigns.

1119
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:55,500
 He conquered much of Western Europe, including modern-day France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.

1120
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:01,500
 Charlemagne was also a devout Christian and worked to spread Christianity throughout his empire.

1121
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:09,500
 In 785, Heron was declared caliph, instead of focusing on conquering like his brethren.

1122
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:15,500
 He instead focused on the scientific growth in the new capital city of Baghdad.

1123
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,500
 Heron Al-Rashid wanted to create the House of Wisdom,

1124
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:23,500
 a library and research center that attracted scholars from around the world.

1125
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:27,500
 These scholars would come to the House of Wisdom with the desire to learn.

1126
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:37,500
 They've translated the works of the past, as well as developing the science of algebra, chemistry, sociology, and the concept of infinity.

1127
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:42,500
 While the Vikings had a different idea of progress,

1128
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:49,500
 the Vikings were a group of uncivilized pagans from modern-day Scandinavia who wanted to gain material wealth.

1129
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:55,500
 So, June 8, 793 AD marked the beginning of the Viking Age in Europe.

1130
01:31:55,500 --> 01:32:02,500
 Lindisfarne was a small, isolated island off the northeast coast of England that was home to a famous monastery

1131
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:06,500
 and considered one of Europe's most important centers of learning.

1132
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:15,500
 On the day of the raid, a group of Viking warriors, likely from Norway or Denmark, landed on the island and attacked the monastery.

1133
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:20,500
 The Vikings pillaged the monastery, killing many monks and taking others as slaves.

1134
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:27,500
 The raid was a brutal and unexpected attack on a place of great religious and cultural significance,

1135
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,500
 and it sent shockwaves throughout Europe.

1136
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:45,500
 In 799, in Rome, Pope Leo III was attacked by a faction of Rome who believed that the Pope was guilty of tyranny

1137
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,500
 and serious personal misconduct.

1138
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:51,500
 So, Pope Leo III ran away to the Frankish Kingdom.

1139
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:58,500
 After this, Charlemagne and his Frank army provided an escort for the Pope and restored him to the papal office.

1140
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:04,500
 But yet, the power of the papacy was being questioned, with many people wanting it to go away,

1141
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:09,500
 which caused Charlemagne to go to Roman late 800 to fight for his Pope.

1142
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:17,500
 For his loyalty on Christmas day in the Basilica of St. Peter, Pope Leo III placed a crown on Charlemagne's head,

1143
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:26,500
 declaring him the new Holy Roman Emperor, creating a new Roman Empire, the Holy Roman Empire,

1144
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:29,500
 or at least the first rendition of it.

1145
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:34,500
 Under Charlemagne, the foundations of a genuinely great empire were forming,

1146
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:42,500
 but once Charlemagne died in 814, the new empire was bludgeoning with problems.

1147
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:50,500
 His son, Louis the Pius, 788-840, inherited an empire filled with problems.

1148
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:59,500
 Many of his own citizens viewed him as a strong Catholic, who was well-intentioned, but was incredibly weak and unable to do anything.

1149
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:07,500
 As the Vikings continued their raids along the Rhine River, attacking Holy Roman Empire cities, such as Cologne, Triir, and Maines,

1150
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:15,500
 raiding various Catholic monasteries and destroying religious artifacts caused fear and hatred among his citizens.

1151
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:20,500
 Why would anyone trust a leader if they can't stop barbaric pagans?

1152
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:27,500
 So, various local leaders started to focus on defending their land, rather than relying on the central government for defense.

1153
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:33,500
 Hence beginning the process of independently recreating the Chinese system of feudalism.

1154
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:41,500
 At this time, people would willingly farm on lands, giving up their freedom to these local leaders to protect them from the Vikings,

1155
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:45,500
 creating the basis of a new system of feudalism.

1156
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:52,500
 While the Holy Roman Empire might have been fighting with the Vikings and the Byzantines were fighting with the Arabs,

1157
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,500
 in 820, a group of Arab raiders landed on the island of Crete.

1158
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:05,500
 Over the next several years, Arab forces gradually gained control of the island, overcoming the resistance of the Byzantine defenders.

1159
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:11,500
 The conquest was completed in 827 and Crete became part of the Arab Empire.

1160
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:15,500
 The conquest of Sicily and Sardinia followed a similar pattern.

1161
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:23,500
 In 827, a large Arab fleet landed on Sicily, and Arab forces quickly gained control of much of the island.

1162
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:28,500
 They then moved on to Sardinia, which fell to the Arab invaders in 828.

1163
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:36,500
 In the Holy Roman Empire, once Louis the Pius died in 840 AD, so did the Charlemagne Empire.

1164
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:46,500
 The infighting between family members grew, leading to the Holy Roman Empire being divided between three family members in the famous Treaty of Verdun.

1165
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:55,500
 In the West, the formation of the West Frankish Kingdom was given to Charlemagne's grandson, Charles the Bald, in modern-day France.

1166
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:04,500
 In the East, the East Frankish Kingdom was given to another grandson, Louis the German, which was obviously settled in modern-day Germany,

1167
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:09,500
 while the Middle Kingdom was given to Charlemagne's eldest son, Lothair.

1168
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:19,500
 However, being squeezed in between the West and East Frankish kingdoms gave the Middle Kingdom a short lifespan, and was practically irrelevant.

1169
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:26,500
 The Vikings weren't just a problem for mainland Europe, they were pillaging everything in mainland England.

1170
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:35,500
 So, in 871, the new king of Wessex, Alfred the Great, rose to power with one thing in mind, keeping everyone safe.

1171
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:42,500
 Alfred built a network of fortifications known as Burs, designed to protect his people from Viking attacks.

1172
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:50,500
 He also developed new military tactics and strategies and fostered alliances with other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.

1173
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:56,500
 Unlike in Great Britain though, the Vikings were actually invited to Russia.

1174
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:03,500
 According to Russian legend, the tribes in Russia were tired of dealing with political strife, so they invited the Varangians,

1175
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:07,500
 a sect of Vikings, to establish order and a government over there.

1176
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:17,500
 Hence, Rurik came with his two brothers to the city of Novgorod, and using the Vikings' famous force, they were able to establish order in the city,

1177
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:22,500
 declaring Rurik is their new king, creating the Kievan-Rus dynasty.

1178
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:31,500
 Under the military leadership of Olag, one of the Rurik kingsmen, the Kievan-Rus started establishing Smolensk, and Kia, in modern-day Ukraine,

1179
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,500
 creating the forefront of Russia today.

1180
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:41,500
 While back in England, expanding upon his grandfather Alfred the Great's alliance network,

1181
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,500
 Athlstan was declared "King of Essex".

1182
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:52,500
 Athlstan was able to get all the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to work together to fend off the Vikings of the British Isles.

1183
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:59,500
 He was declared to be the first king of England due to his ability to navigate alliances and keep everyone safe,

1184
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:04,500
 beginning one of the longest monarchies in human history.

1185
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:12,500
 While the East Frankish kingdom was facing a similar problem, the pagan Magyars were attacking everyone across the kingdom,

1186
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:15,500
 leaving the kingdom to live in fear.

1187
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:24,500
 However, King Otto of the East Frankish Empire was able to defeat the pesky Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.

1188
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:30,500
 Then, in 961, he could fully conquer all of the kingdoms of Italy,

1189
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:34,500
 restoring Christendom to all the former pagans.

1190
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:43,500
 So in 962, Otto I was coronated to Pope John XII in Rome to be the new Holy Roman Emperor.

1191
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:47,500
 In France, though, the West Frankish kingdom was struggling,

1192
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:57,500
 because in 987, King Louis V, a direct descendant of Charlemagne, died at age 20 without leaving an heir to take over their dynasty,

1193
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,500
 leaving the French monarchy in peril.

1194
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:07,500
 So, the French aristocracy had an election between Hugh Capet, a noble with extensive lands in the region of Isle de France,

1195
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,500
 and Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine.

1196
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:20,500
 With the support of Adelbero, the Archbishop of Rome's, Hugh Capet became the first king of France, starting the Capetian dynasty.

1197
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:29,500
 However, at this time, the typical person in Europe was always living in fear.

1198
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:32,500
 Every civilization was on the verge of conquering.

1199
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:36,500
 They've all become land hungry and were willing to fight for it.

1200
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:44,500
 So across Europe at this time, every civilization started to entrench their society in the ideas of feudalism,

1201
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:46,500
 leading to another social pyramid.

1202
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,500
 At the bottom lay the serfs.

1203
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:52,500
 Their job was to farm the land and ensure everyone was fed.

1204
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,500
 Then came the knight, who provided protection for the people.

1205
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:01,500
 Then came the nobles, who ruled over a specific territory, owning the land.

1206
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:05,500
 Then came the kings, as previously mentioned, who gave lands to the nobles.

1207
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:11,500
 But all the way at the top was the Pope, because the Pope could speak directly to God,

1208
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:15,500
 and had God given ownership of all the lands.

1209
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:23,500
 In the early 11th century, Leif Erikson was sent on a voyage to discover lands west of Greenland.

1210
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:27,500
 If you look at a map, west of Greenland is the Americas.

1211
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:32,500
 So Leif and his crew ventured to this new mystical land called Vinland,

1212
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,500
 in modern-day Newfoundland, Canada.

1213
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:42,500
 Leif and his crew spent the winter in Vinland, establishing a small settlement and trading with the local indigenous people.

1214
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:50,500
 They also explored the surrounding area, which they found rich and natural resources, including timber, fish, and game.

1215
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:57,500
 Leif and his crew returned to Greenland in the spring, where they were greeted as heroes for discovering new lands.

1216
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:02,500
 Leif and Leif know that he discovered a new continent for his European people.

1217
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:12,500
 Though significantly less is known about the Americas, some historians believe that at the time,

1218
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:17,500
 a similar type of expansion happened in the American continent, like in Europe.

1219
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:22,500
 Sadly, we just don't have the historical records from this unique period.

1220
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:29,500
 We know that the Mayans down in South America were building the impressive cities of Tickel, Polenke, and Cheech and Idza,

1221
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:34,500
 having a population of anywhere between 2 and 10 million.

1222
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:41,500
 We also know that there were various tribes across the north, including the Cherokee, the Navajo, and the Inuits.

1223
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:46,500
 The Inuits are most likely to have interacted with Leif's fleet.

1224
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:55,500
 While back in Europe, in the holy city of Jerusalem, laid the very famous Church, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

1225
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:01,500
 According to Christian belief, this Church was built on the day Jesus was crucified and resurrected.

1226
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:09,500
 However, in 1009 AD, Arab caliph Al-Hakeem ordered the destruction of this sacred holy site.

1227
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:14,500
 All of the sacred sites were destroyed, leaving them completely annihilated.

1228
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,500
 When the news reached Europe, Christians were horrified.

1229
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:24,500
 Pope Sergius IV sent a circular letter to all churches, calling for a holy fight in the Middle East

1230
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:28,500
 and the expulsion of Muslims from the Holy Land.

1231
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:34,500
 But yet the Arabs of the Abbasid Caliphate would actually be expelled by another before Jerusalem.

1232
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:41,500
 The Seljic Turks, a Central Asian Turkic people of the Muslim faith, were beginning to grow their empire.

1233
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:47,500
 In 1055, they took over the Abbasid Caliphate capital city of Baghdad.

1234
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:53,500
 The Seljic Turks initially respected the caliph, but the Seljics took over the city over time.

1235
01:42:53,500 --> 01:43:01,500
 In 1076, they captured Medina, followed the next year by the capturing of Mecca, the holiest city in Islam.

1236
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:14,500
 Due to this, the Muslim world wasn't ready for Pope Urban II at the Council of Claremont in 1095

1237
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:20,500
 to call upon all Christians to take up arms and liberate the Holy Land from Muslim rule.

1238
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:26,500
 The Pope promised spiritual rewards and forgiveness of sins to those who joined the crusade.

1239
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:31,500
 And many knights, nobles and peasants were inspired to take up the cause.

1240
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:38,500
 Many European nobles, such as Godfrey of Boulion, to lose, Bohemian of Toronto and Robert of Flanders,

1241
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:42,500
 brought their armies from Europe on their journey to Jerusalem.

1242
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:50,500
 While the Christians were united, the Muslims were divided and unable to put up a strong defense against the Crusaders.

1243
01:43:50,500 --> 01:44:00,500
 Hence, the Christians took over the County of Odessa in 1098, and finally the Holy City of Jerusalem in 1099.

1244
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:03,500
 However, the crusade wasn't done.

1245
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:11,500
 In 1144, the Muslim forces led by Turkish ruler Ahmad ad Dinsengi launched a siege against Odessa.

1246
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:17,500
 The city was poorly defended and the Crusaders could not resist the Muslim forces for long.

1247
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:23,500
 After a siege of several weeks, the city was breached and the Muslim forces overran the city,

1248
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,500
 killing or enslaving much of the population.

1249
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:35,500
 But the Christians weren't happy with that, so in 1147, the massive armies of Europe came back with attempts to free Odessa.

1250
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:42,500
 The Crusaders faced significant logistical challenges, including shortages of food and supplies.

1251
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:53,500
 They were also plagued by infighting and political rivalries, which called the campaign to be in ruin after the disastrous loss of the Battle of Anab in 1149,

1252
01:44:53,500 --> 01:45:01,500
 which resulted in the capture of King Louis VII and the loss of much of the Crusader army.

1253
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:11,500
 While the Christians and Muslims were fighting, the Hindus in the Khmer Empire, under King Sir Yavarm in the Second,

1254
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:16,500
 built a fantastic temple for the Hindu god Vishnu called the Angkor Wat.

1255
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:22,500
 Vishnu is an important god in Hinduism, known as the Preserver and Protector of the Universe.

1256
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:30,500
 He has 10 incarnations, or avatars, and is often depicted as having blue skin and holding four objects.

1257
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:40,500
 As you approach Angkor Wat, you are greeted by a massive moat and a grand entrance gate adorned with intricate carvings of mythological creatures and deities.

1258
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:50,500
 The main temple rises like a towering mountain, with intricate carvings and reliefs that tell the stories of Hindu mythology and the history of the Khmer Empire.

1259
01:45:50,500 --> 01:46:00,500
 The temple's galleries are lined with stunning bass reliefs depicting scenes of battles, ceremonies, and daily life in ancient Cambodia.

1260
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:08,500
 At the heart of the complex is the Central Sanctuary, a massive pyramid-like structure surrounded by smaller temples and courtyards.

1261
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:18,500
 The sanctuary is considered the most sacred part of the temple, adorned with intricately carved statues and images of Hindu gods and goddesses.

1262
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:23,500
 It was an incredible feat of human ingenuity.

1263
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:31,500
 But yet in 1187, the Muslim commander from Egypt, Saladin, became fed up with the Christian rule of Jerusalem.

1264
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:38,500
 So he declared a holy war across the Muslim world in order to reconquer Jerusalem from the Christians.

1265
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:43,500
 The battle occurred on a scorching hot day in the hills near the Sea of Galilee.

1266
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:56,500
 Saladin's forces numbered around 20,000. The Crusaders had a much smaller force of around 12,000 knights, soldiers, and civilians under the aptly named King, King Guy.

1267
01:46:56,500 --> 01:47:02,500
 The battle began with skirmishes between the two sides, but soon escalated into a full-scale engagement.

1268
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:10,500
 Saladin's forces could use their superior cavalry to encircle the Crusaders, who could not break through the Muslim lines.

1269
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:16,500
 The heat and thirst soon took a toll on the Crusaders, who were weakened and disoriented.

1270
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:24,500
 The Muslim forces took advantage of the situation. They launched a fierce attack, breaking through the Crusader lines and capturing many knights.

1271
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:29,500
 King Guy and a small group of knights were able to escape the battlefield.

1272
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,500
 Still, the majority of the Crusader army was destroyed.

1273
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:43,500
 The loss of the battle was a severe blow to the Christian forces in the region, and it paved the way for Saladin's conquest of Jerusalem.

1274
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:49,500
 But the Christians weren't going to allow that, so guess what happened. Another crusade.

1275
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:58,500
 This time, the three most powerful monarchs at the time, Emperor Frederick I of the Holy Roman Empire, King Richard I of England,

1276
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:05,500
 and King Philip II of France sent their best armies to reconquer the holy city of Jerusalem.

1277
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:15,500
 However, all the force in the world couldn't retake Jerusalem from the grips of Saladin, leaving the third crusade to be a failure.

1278
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:30,500
 Genghis was born to a mother kidnapped by his father and forced into marriage. Legend holds that he came into this world, clutching a blood clot in his right hand.

1279
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:41,500
 Before he turned ten, his father was poisoned to death by an enemy clan. Genghis's clan then deserted him, his mother, and his six siblings to avoid having to feed them.

1280
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:52,500
 However, he soon began to make friends with the other clans throughout the Mongolian mountainside. By 1206, he had united all the various tribes, uniting one million people.

1281
01:48:52,500 --> 01:49:03,500
 For the time, Genghis was quite progressive. He made it illegal to sell and kidnap women, banished the idea of enslavement of any Mongol, and even allowed freedom of religion.

1282
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:18,500
 When it came to war, Genghis was as barbaric as the next one. His first campaign was against the Shishah Kingdom in 1209, his army of mostly cavalrymen on horses quickly outnumbered and destroyed the kingdom.

1283
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:32,500
 His next target was the Xin dynasty in China. From 1211 to 1214, the outnumbered Mongols ravaged the countryside, causing food shortages resulting in the Xin army, killing tens of thousands of their own parents.

1284
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:43,500
 Just so their elites could live. In 1214, the Mongols besieged the capital of Zongdu, now Beijing, and burnt it to the ground.

1285
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:52,500
 In the early 13th century, King John was facing increasing pressure from his barons, who were demanding greater rights and protections under the law.

1286
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:57,500
 In response to their demands, John agreed to meet with the barons and negotiate a settlement.

1287
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:06,500
 The result of these negotiations was the Magna Carta, a document that set out a series of rights and freedoms that the king could not violate.

1288
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:15,500
 Among these rights were the right to a fair trial, the right to do process of law, and the right to be protected from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.

1289
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:26,500
 The Magna Carta also established the principle of habeas corpus, which required the government to produce a prisoner in court and provide a lawful reason for their detention.

1290
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:33,500
 This principle has been a cornerstone of modern legal systems around the world.

1291
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:46,500
 Then in 1217, there was another crusade, this time led by King Andrew II of Hungary, and Duke Leopold VI of Austria, with the same goal in mind to take over Jerusalem.

1292
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:54,500
 The crusaders successfully captured the city of Deimietta in 1219, but they could not advance further into Egypt.

1293
01:50:54,500 --> 01:51:04,500
 After a series of setbacks, including capture and imprisonment of many crusaders, the Christian forces were forced to abandon their campaign in Egypt.

1294
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:14,500
 The crusaders eventually agreed to a treaty with the Muslim forces, allowing them to leave Egypt unharmed, but without achieving their ultimate goal.

1295
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:26,500
 Genghis Khan wasn't done though, and 1219 went to war against the Quares' Empire in present-day Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Iran.

1296
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:35,500
 During his raids, the Mongol hordes swept through one city after another, taking over the likes of Bercara, Samarkand, and Urgente.

1297
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:42,500
 Skilled workers such as carpenters and jewelers were usually saved, while aristocrats and resisting soldiers were killed.

1298
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:48,500
 On skilled workers, meanwhile, were often used as human shields during the next assault.

1299
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:59,500
 No one knows with any certainty how many people died during Genghis Khan's wars, in part because the Mongols propagated their vicious image as a way of spreading terror.

1300
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:07,500
 At Genghis Khan's death, he controlled a massive territory from the Sea of Japan to the Caspian Sea.

1301
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:17,500
 However, even more impressively, around 8% of the men in South Asia descend from Genghis Khan today.

1302
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:27,500
 In 1228, Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire tried to conquer the Holy Land, but failed ending the Sixth Crusade.

1303
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:31,500
 Of course, the Holy Roman Empire couldn't be the only one crusading.

1304
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:38,500
 King Louis IX of France in 1248 decided to start the Seventh Crusade to retake Jerusalem,

1305
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:44,500
 but he was taken prisoner by the Muslims and forced to pay a hefty ransom as he retreated.

1306
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:54,500
 However, that didn't deter King Louis IX, because in 1270 he was at it again, trying to free Jerusalem from the grips of Muslim rule.

1307
01:52:54,500 --> 01:53:04,500
 But this time, he died of dysentery. Once King Louis IX died, his troops retreated, creating the eighth and final time there was a crusade.

1308
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:13,500
 In England, in 1295, England was making a diplomatic headway, and a letter summoning Parliament, King Edward I,

1309
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:19,500
 since the most righteous law of the Emperor's ordains that what touches all should be approved by all,

1310
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:24,500
 so it appears that common dangers should be met by remedies agreed upon in common.

1311
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:32,500
 As King Edward, I would then request a tenth of the incomes of nobles and an eleventh of the income of knights,

1312
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:38,500
 creating one of the first parliaments we would see in the New Age.

1313
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:44,500
 While down in Africa, a leader of extravagant wealth, Mansa Musa was gaining power.

1314
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:51,500
 On his famous hajj, a religious Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim should make at least once in his life,

1315
01:53:51,500 --> 01:54:00,500
 Mansa Musa, with his caravan of camels and an army of scholars, gave vast amounts of gold to any poor person he saw,

1316
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:06,500
 hence crashing all of the economies in northern Africa due to the inflation of gold.

1317
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:13,500
 When Mansa Musa returned to Mali, he made it his life purpose to make Timbuktu the Muslim capital of knowledge.

1318
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:18,500
 So, Mansa Musa invested heavily in building the University of San Kaur.

1319
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:25,500
 Various Islamic faith scholars quickly made their way to San Kaur to study Islamic theology, law, and literature

1320
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:28,500
 with over one million manuscripts.

1321
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:35,500
 Mansa Musa was also a very religious man with a policy that he commissioned a new mosque every Friday.

1322
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:42,500
 However, sadly though, only the Jhingirabur Mosque in Timbuktu stood the test of time.

1323
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:50,500
 In the Americas though, another built on riches was being created.

1324
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:58,500
 As Aztec legend has it, the god Weetsilapochshili directed them to build where they saw an eagle perched on a cactus,

1325
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,500
 eating a snake.

1326
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:05,500
 When they saw this exact scene on an island located in what was once Lake Texcoco,

1327
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:11,500
 they interpreted it as a sign from their god and founded Tenochitlan on that island.

1328
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:16,500
 As time passed, Tenochitlan started to build impressive temples such as the Great Temple.

1329
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:23,500
 The Great Temple comprised of two main structures, dedicated to the gods Weetsilapochtili and Tlailok.

1330
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:26,500
 The city itself was most fascinating.

1331
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:31,500
 It was designed with a complex system of canals and causeways to help control flooding

1332
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:38,500
 and facilitate transport across the city, while they started to farm on floating gardens known as chinampas

1333
01:55:38,500 --> 01:55:46,500
 on the shallow waters of Lake Texcoco, which were used to grow crops such as maize, beans, and squash.

1334
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:54,500
 As Mali and the Aztecs were building their cities, England and France were in war for 100 years.

1335
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:58,500
 The origins of the conflict lay with the status of the Duchy of Gai'en.

1336
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:03,500
 In basic capitalistic terms, this was owned by the British Crown.

1337
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:06,500
 However, the land itself was in France.

1338
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:14,500
 The second reason was that the last direct descendant of Charlemagne, King Charles IV, died in 1328.

1339
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:18,500
 So the next closest relative was Edward III, the King of England.

1340
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:26,500
 So King Edward III claimed the rule of France in 1337, which was not liked by the French people.

1341
01:56:26,500 --> 01:56:37,500
 As the petty, erratic, hundred years war raged on, the people of the world had to face a pandemic like no other, the bubonic plague.

1342
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:56,500
 As the Italian poet Giavani Bocaccio wrote, "At the beginning of the malady, certain swellings, either on the groin or under the armpits, waxed to the bigness of a common apple, others to the size of an egg, some more and some less, and these the vulgar named Plague Boyons."

1343
01:56:56,500 --> 01:57:04,500
 Historians believe this pandemic was spread by rats, traveling through ships across Europe and merchants throughout the Silk Road.

1344
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:10,500
 No matter how this plague was produced, around 75 to 200 million people died.

1345
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:23,500
 With the death of so many people, especially the poor, landowners and nobles were required to allow farmers to keep more of the product they farmed, leading to more workers' rights.

1346
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:30,500
 In China, though, a group of rebels known as the Red Turbins revolted against the Mongol rulers of China.

1347
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:36,500
 The Red Turbins were led by a man named Zu Hengan, born into a poor peasant family.

1348
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:42,500
 Zu built a strong following among the rebel forces, and eventually emerged as their leader.

1349
01:57:42,500 --> 01:57:52,500
 In 1368, Zu declared himself emperor and established the Ming dynasty, marking the beginning of a new era in Chinese history.

1350
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:11,500
 In 1428, at the age of 16, Joan left her home in the village of Domermi and traveled to the court of Charles VII, where she asked for permission to lead the French army against the English.

1351
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:15,500
 At first, her request was met with skepticism and disbelief.

1352
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:20,500
 Still, Joan persisted and eventually won the support of the French commanders.

1353
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:26,500
 Joan's first major military victory came in the siege of Orleans in 1429.

1354
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:34,500
 She led the French troops in a series of daring attacks on the English forces, and she broke the siege and liberated the city.

1355
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:40,500
 This victory boosted French morale and helped to turn the tide of the war in their favor.

1356
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:49,500
 Over the next several months, Joan led the French army to victories against the English, including the Battle of Pate in June, 1429.

1357
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:54,500
 However, her success also made her enemies in the English in French court.

1358
01:58:54,500 --> 01:59:01,500
 In 1430, she was captured by the English and put on trial for heresy and witchcraft.

1359
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:04,500
 Joan was subjected to a grueling trial.

1360
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:12,500
 She was accused of various crimes, including dressing in men's clothing, practicing sorcery, and hearing voices.

1361
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:20,500
 Despite the odds against her, Joan remained steadfast in her faith, and her belief that she was carrying out God's will.

1362
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:26,500
 In the end, Joan was found guilty and sentenced to death by burning at stake.

1363
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:31,500
 She was executed on May 30, 1431 at 19.

1364
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:39,500
 Then, 20 years later, in the Battle of Castilian, Charles VII of France led a French army, which defeated the English army,

1365
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:45,500
 effectively ending English territorial claims in France.

1366
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:51,500
 While back in the great city of Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire was declining.

1367
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:56,500
 Weakened by years of war, political instability, and economic turmoil.

1368
01:59:56,500 --> 02:00:02,500
 In contrast, the Ottoman Empire, led by Sultan Mehmed II, was on the rise.

1369
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:10,500
 And the Sultan saw an opportunity to expand his empire and gain control of the strategic city of Constantinople.

1370
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:23,500
 By 1453, Mehmed II led an army of 80,000 soldiers, including elite, janissary troops and a powerful artillery force to besiege Constantinople.

1371
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:30,500
 The Byzantine defenders, led by Emperor Constantine XI, were vastly outnumbered and outgunned.

1372
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:35,500
 They faced a seemingly impossible task to hold off the Ottoman assault.

1373
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:43,500
 The Ottomans bombarded the city with artillery for nearly two months, causing extensive damage to the walls and fortifications.

1374
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:50,500
 The Byzantine defenders, meanwhile, struggled to maintain morale and keep their troops fed and supplied.

1375
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:57,500
 Then, on the fateful day, May 29, 1453, the Ottomans launched a massive assault on the city,

1376
02:00:57,500 --> 02:01:00,500
 climbing up, covered by siege towers.

1377
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:04,500
 They were able to breach the walls and gain access to the city.

1378
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:09,500
 Despite putting up a valiant defense, the Byzantine defenders were overwhelmed,

1379
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:17,500
 and the Ottomans were able to storm the city and capture the capital, causing the great Byzantine Empire to fall.

1380
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:26,500
 In 1453, all paths no longer led to Rome, and all traces back to the Empire of Caesar were erased.

1381
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:31,500
 It was replaced by the beginning of utter Ottoman domination in the region,

1382
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:38,500
 ushering in a new era of Turkish power and influence in the Mediterranean.

1383
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:45,500
 While the Byzantines might have been falling, the Russians were finally gaining their independence.

1384
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:54,500
 At the time, the Mongol Empire was ruling over Russia, demanding that various Russian towns pay tribute or face the wrath of the Mongols.

1385
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:59,500
 However, in 1472, Ivan the Great refused to pay such tribute.

1386
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:09,500
 Over the next several years, he built up his military strength and was able to drive out the Mongol garrisons from various cities and towns throughout Russia.

1387
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:15,500
 In 1480, the Mongols demanded that Ivan pay tribute or face military action,

1388
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:19,500
 but after a tense standoff, they finally retreated.

1389
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:25,500
 Ivan's victory was the beginning of a free Russia and that a climb of the Mongolian Empire.

1390
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:35,500
 Then, in 1492, as Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue, the Europeans discovered the New World.

1391
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:43,500
 Said initially on finding a path to India, instead he landed on an island in the Bahamas, which he aptly named "San Salvador."

1392
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:49,500
 When he and his crew set up camp, he met the Luqayans, skilled fishermen and farmers,

1393
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:54,500
 who welcomed him and his crew and provided them with food and supplies.

1394
02:02:54,500 --> 02:03:04,500
 While back in Europe, a golden age of culture was upon us.

1395
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:08,500
 In 1503, Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa.

1396
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:16,500
 Da Vinci's biographer Walter Isaacson says, "The Mona Lisa, to me, is the greatest emotional painting ever done.

1397
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:26,500
 The way the smile flickers makes it a work of art and science because Leonardo understood optics, the muscles of the lips, and how light strikes the eye.

1398
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:31,500
 All of it goes into making the Mona Lisa smile so mysterious and elusive.

1399
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:45,500
 In 1504, Michelangelo sculpted David. Michelangelo would say, "An every block of marble I see a statue was plain as though it stood before me, shaped in perfect in attitude and action.

1400
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:53,500
 I have only to hue away the rough walls that imprisoned the lovely apparition to reveal it to the other eyes as mine see it."

1401
02:03:53,500 --> 02:04:00,500
 While in 1506, Michelangelo was painting the magnificent painting of the Sistine Chapel.

1402
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:13,500
 While in the political world, Niccolo Machiavelli is one of, if not the most influential, pieces of literature we have today.

1403
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:20,500
 The Prince is a political manifesto that comments on the past civilizations we've heard about in this video.

1404
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:39,500
 Machiavelli writes, "It is much safer to be feared than loved because love is preserved by the link of obligation, which owing to the baseness of men is broken at every opportunity for their advantage, but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails."

1405
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:49,500
 Think about the ordinary farmer. Think about the man who spends generations of their life farming, giving heavy taxes to a noble lord for doing nothing except protecting them.

1406
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:55,500
 Why won't the farmers rebel? It's because they're afraid of what would happen without their leaders.

1407
02:04:55,500 --> 02:05:06,500
 Without the elites, the Huns or the Mongols can come to your farm and destroy you on their own, so you live in fear as to what might happen to you, leaving you to give your wheat to said leader.

1408
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:20,500
 Martin Luther, though, didn't just report on the basics of human nature. Martin wanted to make a difference and was sick of the Catholic Church.

1409
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:30,500
 At the time, the Catholic Church was selling indulgences, which were certificates that people could purchase to reduce the amount of time they would spend in purgatory after they died.

1410
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:40,500
 Luther believed this practice was corrupt and went against the Bible's teachings, which emphasized the importance of repentance and faith over material wealth.

1411
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:49,500
 In protest, he wrote a series of 95 Theses, or arguments challenging the Church's authority and calling for reform.

1412
02:05:49,500 --> 02:06:01,500
 On October 31, 1517, Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, which was a common way of announcing a public debate or discussion.

1413
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:08,500
 Luther's 95 Theses sparked a debate within the Church and among European scholars and theologians.

1414
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:15,500
 Some people agreed with his criticisms of the Church, while others saw him as a heretic and a threat to the established order.

1415
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:19,500
 The beginning of Protestantism was upon us.

1416
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:31,500
 In 1519, though, the Spanish conquistadors, under the leadership of Hernan Cortez, arrived on the Aztec shores.

1417
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:38,500
 They were greeted by the Aztecs, who gave gifts of gold and silver of incredible wealth to the Spanish,

1418
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:42,500
 as they believed that the Spaniards were emissaries of the god Quetzal Colaudal.

1419
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:51,500
 However, Cortez soon revealed his true intentions to conquer the Aztec Empire and claim its wealth for Spain.

1420
02:06:51,500 --> 02:07:00,500
 Over several years, Cortez and his forces engaged in a series of battles with the Aztecs, marked by intense violence and brutality.

1421
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:06,500
 The Spanish were aided by their superior military technology, including guns and cannons,

1422
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:11,500
 and by the support of indigenous allies, who were the enemies of the Aztecs.

1423
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:17,500
 Despite being vastly outnumbered, Cortez and his men made significant gains against the Aztecs,

1424
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:22,500
 eventually laying siege to their capital city of Tenochitlan.

1425
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:30,500
 After months of fighting, the city fell to the Spanish in 1521, and the Aztec Empire was effectively destroyed.

1426
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:40,500
 Then, following the strategy of Cortez, Francisco Pizarro led an expedition that conquered the Incan Empire in present-day Peru.

1427
02:07:40,500 --> 02:07:46,500
 Though the violence was authoritarian, the biohazards were even more demanding.

1428
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:55,500
 The Europeans, due to having survived illnesses such as the bubonic plague in smallpox, developed immunity to many of these diseases that they've,

1429
02:07:55,500 --> 02:08:01,500
 one way or another, spread to the native people, essentially over time, killing them off.

1430
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:14,500
 Under Suleiman the Magnificence Leadership, the Ottoman Empire became one of the most powerful and influential empires in world history.

1431
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:23,500
 Suleiman was a brilliant strategist and military leader, and his reign was marked by significant conquests and political achievements.

1432
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:27,500
 Like many other leaders, he set out to conquer the world.

1433
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:36,500
 By the end of his reign, Suleiman the Magnificence presided over a vast empire that stretched from southeastern Europe to the deserts of Arabia,

1434
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:40,500
 and from the shores of the Mediterranean to the plains of Persia.

1435
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:49,500
 His conquests included the capture of Belgrade in Budapest in Europe, Jerusalem and Mecca in the Middle East, and Tabriz and Baghdad in Persia.

1436
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:59,500
 The Ottomans also became the dominant naval power in the Mediterranean, with control over North African cities such as Algiers and Tunis,

1437
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:02,500
 creating the dominant Ottoman civilization.

1438
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:18,500
 But yet, all things fall when one is in love, and the murder-happy King Henry had fallen in love with Anne Boylan and was desperate to marry her.

1439
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:24,500
 However, Catherine of Aragon was still alive, and the Catholic Church did not recognize divorce.

1440
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:32,500
 Henry's solution was to break away from the Catholic Church and establish the Church of England with himself as the head.

1441
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:42,500
 In 1534, Henry passed the Act of Supremacy, which declared that the King, not the Pope, was the supreme head of the Church of England,

1442
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:52,500
 leaving the Catholic Church to be angry and excommunicate Henry VII, leaving a schism between the Church of England and the Catholic Church even today.

1443
02:09:56,500 --> 02:10:04,500
 Ivan the Terrible is now the ruler of Russia. In the early years of his reign, Ivan enjoyed significant success,

1444
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:09,500
 launching military campaigns against neighboring kingdoms and expanding Russia's borders.

1445
02:10:09,500 --> 02:10:17,500
 He also oversaw the construction of magnificent public works, including St. Basil's Cathedral and Moscow.

1446
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:23,500
 However, as Ivan grew older, he became increasingly paranoid and erratic.

1447
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:30,500
 He launched a series of brutal purges and executions, targeting anyone he perceived as threatening his power.

1448
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:37,500
 He also had a volatile temper, lashing out at advisors and nobles who dared to question his decisions.

1449
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:44,500
 In 1560, Ivan suffered a devastating personal loss when his beloved wife Anastasia died.

1450
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:53,500
 This event seems to have triggered a significant psychological breakdown, and Ivan became increasingly unstable and violent.

1451
02:10:53,500 --> 02:11:11,500
 He launched a series of bloody campaigns against his own people, including the notorious Oprah-Chenina, a campaign of terror and repression that killed thousands of Russians and destroyed countless homes and families, truly deserving of the name Terrible.

1452
02:11:12,500 --> 02:11:24,500
 While Russia was going through that, England was on the rise with the start of the English Renaissance under the leadership of Queen Elizabeth I.

1453
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:31,500
 Elizabethan playwrights dominated the scene, creating written words that were poetic in language and poignant in meeting.

1454
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:35,500
 They've even written plays about people we've already talked about.

1455
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:46,500
 William Shakespeare wrote many plays, including Histories, Julius Caesar, which was about the assassination of Julius Caesar, King John, which was about the Hundred Years War,

1456
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:51,500
 and Henry VII was a play about showing human needs to gain power.

1457
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:58,500
 Other notable playwrights who filled the scene were Christopher Marlow, Ben Johnson, and John Webster.

1458
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:09,500
 While on the other side of the world, the English colony of Jamestown was forming in Virginia, under the Virginia Trading Company.

1459
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:17,500
 Slightly up north, Samuel Dushemplain was establishing the French colony of Quebec and Canada.

1460
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:27,500
 While back in the old world, they were having a new era of fighting, the Thirty Years War.

1461
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:31,500
 This time, it was between the Protestants and the Catholics.

1462
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:40,500
 It began in 1618 when the Holy Roman Emperor attempted to impose Catholicism on the Protestant population of Bohemia.

1463
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:45,500
 The Bohemians rebelled, and soon the conflicts spread throughout the region.

1464
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:53,500
 Over the next 30 years, armies marched and counter marched across Europe, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation.

1465
02:12:53,500 --> 02:13:00,500
 The war was characterized by brutal seizures, bloody battles, and atrocities committed by both sides.

1466
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:09,500
 At its height, the war involved most of the major powers of Europe, including France, Spain, Sweden, and the Holy Roman Empire.

1467
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:16,500
 It was fought along religious, political, and economic lines, with each side vying for dominance and control.

1468
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:23,500
 The war finally ended in 1648, with the signing of the Peace of Westphalia.

1469
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:30,500
 The treaty recognized the Dutch Republic's independence, established the individual state sovereignty within the Holy Roman Empire,

1470
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:34,500
 and ended the religious conflicts that fueled the war.

1471
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:45,500
 While in China, the Ming Court was plagued by corruption, factionalism, and economic decline.

1472
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:52,500
 The emperor at the time, Chongzhen, faced mounting pressure from his advisers to strengthen the military,

1473
02:13:52,500 --> 02:13:54,500
 and defend against the Manchu threat.

1474
02:13:54,500 --> 02:14:00,500
 However, his efforts were hindered by infighting among officials and a lack of resources.

1475
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:07,500
 In 1644, the Manchu army, led by Prince Dorgan, launched a massive invasion of China.

1476
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:15,500
 The Ming army, weakened by years of neglect and corruption, was no match for the highly disciplined and skilled Manchu forces.

1477
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:25,500
 The Manchu's quickly conquered Beijing and installed their puppet emperor, ending the Ming dynasty, continuing the cycle of dynasties in China.

1478
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:39,500
 While in Spain, King Charles II died without having any heirs, creating a real political crisis of who should be the leader.

1479
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:46,500
 King Louis XIV of France supported his grandson, Philip, as the rightful heir to the Spanish throne,

1480
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:50,500
 hoping to secure French influence over Spain and its territories.

1481
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:59,500
 On the other hand, Emperor Leopold I of Austria supported the candidacy of Archduke Charles, a member of the Habsburg dynasty,

1482
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:04,500
 who was seen as a potential ally against French expansionism.

1483
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:11,500
 The conflict soon escalated into a major war, with many European powers taking sides and forming alliances.

1484
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:21,500
 The principal belligerence were France and Spain against a coalition of Austria, Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Portugal, and several other minor powers.

1485
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:32,500
 The war ended with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which recognized Philip as King of Spain, but required him to renounce any claims to the French throne,

1486
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:36,500
 and cede some territories to Great Britain and Austria.

1487
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:42,500
 The Treaty of Rastat signed the following year, officially ended the war.

1488
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:52,500
 In 1707, the acts of the Union were passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland,

1489
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:57,500
 which united the two kingdoms into a single political entity known as Great Britain,

1490
02:15:57,500 --> 02:16:01,500
 hence creating the legal foothold that is Great Britain.

1491
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:04,500
 However, Scotland took a disliking to this.

1492
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:08,500
 There were protests and uprisings in the years following the Union,

1493
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:18,500
 including the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, which aimed to restore the Scottish monarchy and independence.

1494
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:32,500
 Then, on July 4th, 1776, a group of American patriots stood in a room in Philadelphia,

1495
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:37,500
 signing a document that would say the words, "We hold these truths to be self-evident,

1496
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:43,500
 that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,

1497
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:47,500
 that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

1498
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:51,500
 War in the Americas was on.

1499
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:58,500
 But back in Europe, the tone was quite different.

1500
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:05,500
 Adam Smith published the famous book, The Wealth of Nations, the Foundations of Lazé's Fair Economics,

1501
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:09,500
 which essentially says the market would balance itself out over time.

1502
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:15,500
 In Austria, Mozart was performing his magnum opus, The Halfner Serenade.

1503
02:17:15,500 --> 02:17:23,500
 Mozart's Halfner Serenade is a charming and elegant work featuring courtly dance music in light, lyrical melodies,

1504
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:29,500
 its graceful melodies, subtle harmonies, and elegant instrumental writing characterizes.

1505
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:39,500
 As the war continued, King George III sent his armies of the masses over to America.

1506
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:47,500
 Though the colonists had little military training, their knowledge of the terrain and guerrilla tactics made them nearly invisible.

1507
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:52,500
 At the same time, the Red Army coats were easy to see for the Americans.

1508
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:59,500
 In the summer of 1781, George Washington and French General Rochembeau marched their forces south to Virginia,

1509
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:03,500
 where they laid siege to Cornwallis and his army at Yorktown.

1510
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:08,500
 The British were trapped and could not escape by land or sea.

1511
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:10,500
 The siege dragged on for weeks.

1512
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:15,500
 The American and French forces bombarded the British with artillery.

1513
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:19,500
 They dug trenches to inch their way closer to the British defenses.

1514
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:25,500
 The French Navy defeated the British Navy in a crucial naval battle off the coast of Virginia,

1515
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:28,500
 cutting off Cornwallis's only escape route by sea.

1516
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:36,500
 On October 14, 1781, the American and French forces launched a massive assault on the British defenses.

1517
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:43,500
 The British fought valiantly, but were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, and they soon began to falter.

1518
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:49,500
 On October 19th, Cornwallis surrendered his army to Washington, effectively ending the war.

1519
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:57,500
 The victory at Yorktown was a decisive moment in the war, and it marked the end of British rule in America,

1520
02:18:57,500 --> 02:19:00,500
 and the beginning of a new experiment.

1521
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:11,500
 With America finally being free from the totally tyrannical grips of Britain, they had one issue.

1522
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:13,500
 How were they going to lead?

1523
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:16,500
 Were they going to make General George Washington their monarch?

1524
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:19,500
 Therefore, democracy was chosen.

1525
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:23,500
 However, Plato made a good point many years ago,

1526
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:29,500
 that the common man was incapable and not wise enough to pick a better leader to lead them to success.

1527
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:36,500
 So the American founded constitutional convention came up with this idea of the Electoral College,

1528
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:42,500
 where the common man would vote for a particular person who would then have a say in who could be president.

1529
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:47,500
 So instead of the president being directly voted on by the people, they would vote on elites,

1530
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:50,500
 who would then vote for the president directly.

1531
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:59,500
 The French then noticed how well the American Revolution went.

1532
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:05,500
 At the time, the French were ruled by King Louis XVI, and his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette.

1533
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:10,500
 As Queen Marie Antoinette told the peasants, "Let them eat cake."

1534
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:12,500
 The people of France got together.

1535
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:16,500
 They decided they wanted more say in how the country was run,

1536
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:22,500
 and they formed a group called the National Assembly, and started making new laws to give them more rights.

1537
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:27,500
 One of the most famous events of the French Revolution was the storming of the Bastille.

1538
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:31,500
 This was a prison that represented the king's power,

1539
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:34,500
 and the people wanted to show that they were not afraid of him.

1540
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:40,500
 They broke into the prison and freed the prisoners, which started a revolution throughout France.

1541
02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:45,500
 Many influential people lost their heads during the revolution,

1542
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:50,500
 including King Louis XVI and his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette.

1543
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:55,500
 The people were tired of being ruled by a king and a queen who didn't care about them,

1544
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:59,500
 and they wanted to create a new system where everyone would have a say.

1545
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:03,500
 And the people of France voted in Maximilian Robespierre.

1546
02:21:03,500 --> 02:21:09,500
 In 1789, Robespierre was elected as a delegate to the estates general,

1547
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:13,500
 which was convened to address France's financial crisis.

1548
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:17,500
 He quickly emerged as a leading voice in the National Assembly,

1549
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:22,500
 advocating for the ordinary people's rights and opposing the aristocracy's power.

1550
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:29,500
 As the revolution continued though, Robespierre became increasingly radical in his views,

1551
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:35,500
 advocating for the execution of King Louis XVI and the establishment of a republic.

1552
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:40,500
 He was elected to the powerful Committee of Public Safety in 1793,

1553
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:45,500
 tasked with protecting the revolution and rooting out enemies of the state.

1554
02:21:45,500 --> 02:21:52,500
 Under Robespierre's leadership, the Committee launched a period of intense repression known as the "rain of terror."

1555
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:58,500
 Thousands of people were arrested, tried, and executed for crimes against the revolution.

1556
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:03,500
 Robespierre became known as a ruthless and uncompromising figure.

1557
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:08,500
 However, Robespierre's power began to wane as the people grew tired of the violence

1558
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:11,500
 and the instability of the revolution.

1559
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:17,500
 In 1794, he was arrested and imprisoned, along with his closest allies.

1560
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:25,500
 On July 28, 1794, Robespierre was taken to the guillotine and executed.

1561
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:31,500
 The execution marked the end of the "rain of terror" and "democracy for now" in France.

1562
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:34,500
 Instead, they moved to a directory.

1563
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:39,500
 A directory is a government led by a five-member executive council, known as the Directory,

1564
02:22:39,500 --> 02:22:42,500
 which was chosen by the Council of Elders.

1565
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:46,500
 This legislative body was also part of the new government.

1566
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:49,500
 The directory was meant to serve as a moderating force,

1567
02:22:49,500 --> 02:22:55,500
 balancing the interests of the various factions that had emerged during the revolution.

1568
02:22:55,500 --> 02:23:03,500
 However, the Directory concept wasn't successful as well,

1569
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:07,500
 so General Napoleon Bonaparte decided to overthrow the government

1570
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:11,500
 and begin his conquests to take over the world.

1571
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:15,500
 So, off Napoleon went to conquer much of Europe.

1572
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:22,500
 In 1805, Napoleon defeated a combined, Austro-Russian army at the Battle of Austrolets,

1573
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:26,500
 solidifying his position as one of Europe's most powerful leaders.

1574
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:32,500
 He then conquered much of the continent, including Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands.

1575
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:37,500
 In 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia with a massive army.

1576
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:44,500
 Still, the campaign proved disastrous, and his forces were decimated by the harsh Russian winter.

1577
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:48,500
 The defeat marked the beginning of Napoleon's downfall.

1578
02:23:48,500 --> 02:23:54,500
 In 1814, the European powers allied against Napoleon and invaded France,

1579
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:59,500
 forcing him to abdicate his throne and go into exile on the island of Elba.

1580
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:05,500
 However, he returned to France in 1815, in what became known as the Hundred Days,

1581
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:12,500
 and briefly regained power before being defeated by the British and Prussian armies at the Battle of Waterloo.

1582
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:21,500
 While back in the Americas, Simone Belivar was on his military campaigns

1583
02:24:21,500 --> 02:24:27,500
 to free Latin American countries from the grasp of the Spanish colonial rule.

1584
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:32,500
 Belivar began his military campaigns in Venezuela in 1810,

1585
02:24:32,500 --> 02:24:37,500
 where he led a successful uprising against the Spanish colonial authorities.

1586
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:42,500
 He then moved on to Colombia, where he won a series of important victories against the Spanish,

1587
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:49,500
 including the Battle of Boyaka in 1890, which secured the independence of Colombia.

1588
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:55,500
 Belivar then turned his attention to Ecuador and Peru, where he won a series of decisive battles

1589
02:24:55,500 --> 02:24:58,500
 that helped secure both countries' independence.

1590
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:05,500
 He captured the city of Lima in 1824, effectively ending Spanish control of Peru.

1591
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:13,500
 Belivar's final military campaign was in Bolivia, where he led the fight for independence against the Spanish in 1825.

1592
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:19,500
 Belivia was named an honor of Bolivar, who played a critical role in its liberation.

1593
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:29,500
 In 1848, two men had an idea that would spark debate worldwide.

1594
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:35,500
 Karl Marx and Frederick Engels wrote the book called "The Communist Manifesto",

1595
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:40,500
 which is a book about the idea of communism, where instead of a capitalistic system,

1596
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:47,500
 where the nobles or bourgeois own everything and the workers and proletariat's work for slave wages,

1597
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:53,500
 instead, what if the proletariat's owned the means of production and all work together,

1598
02:25:53,500 --> 02:26:00,500
 as Marx and Engels would write, "Let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution.

1599
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:06,500
 The proletarians would have nothing to lose but their chains, and they have, and they'd to win."

1600
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:11,500
 They would also write, "The need for a constantly expanding market for its products

1601
02:26:11,500 --> 02:26:14,500
 chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe.

1602
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:21,500
 It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere."

1603
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:26,500
 The Communist Manifesto

1604
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:33,500
 Right after the writing of the Communist Manifesto began a period in Europe known as the "Scramble for Africa".

1605
02:26:33,500 --> 02:26:40,500
 It all began in the 1870s when European countries began to explore the interior of Africa,

1606
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:44,500
 looking for new territories to claim and resources to exploit.

1607
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:50,500
 At first, the European powers were cautious, sending explorers and missionaries into Africa

1608
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:54,500
 to establish trade networks and alliances with local leaders.

1609
02:26:54,500 --> 02:27:00,500
 However, as competition increased, the European powers became more aggressive in their tactics.

1610
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:04,500
 They used military force to establish colonies and protectorates,

1611
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:12,500
 and they engaged in diplomatic maneuvering and propaganda campaigns to gain the support of local populations.

1612
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:19,500
 One of the most ruthless tactics the European powers used was dividing Africa into artificial borders,

1613
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:23,500
 and creating new ethnic and linguistic divisions.

1614
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:31,500
 This created tensions and conflicts between different African groups, which the Europeans used to their advantage,

1615
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:37,500
 creating a European stronghold over the continent of Africa to increase their profits.

1616
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:41,500
 The Scramble for Africa came to an end as a result of several factors,

1617
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:48,500
 including changing international politics, economic realities, and rising African nationalism.

1618
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:53,500
 One of the key factors that contributed to the end of the Scramble for Africa

1619
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:56,500
 was the changing balance of power in Europe.

1620
02:27:56,500 --> 02:28:03,500
 By the early 20th century, European powers were increasingly focused on competition with each other,

1621
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:09,500
 particularly in Europe itself, and were less interested in acquiring new colonies in Africa.

1622
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:14,500
 This was due in part to the growing tensions between European powers

1623
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:20,500
 that would eventually lead to the outbreak of World War I in 1914.

1624
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:31,500
 Because on June 28, 1914, a shot was heard around the world with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

1625
02:28:31,500 --> 02:28:35,500
 Franz Ferdinand was the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary,

1626
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:43,500
 and his assassination by a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip sparked a diplomatic crisis

1627
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:46,500
 quickly escalated into a global conflict.

1628
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:51,500
 In the aftermath of the assassination, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia,

1629
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:58,500
 triggering a complex web of alliances and treaties that drew other countries into the conflict.

1630
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:03,500
 Germany, an ally of Austria-Hungary, declared war on Russia and France,

1631
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:08,500
 while Great Britain, which had a treaty with Belgium, declared war on Germany.

1632
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:15,500
 Within weeks, most of Europe was embroiled in a brutal and devastating conflict.

1633
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:20,500
 In November 1918, after four years of brutal fighting,

1634
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:24,500
 the Allied powers and the Central powers agreed to an armistice,

1635
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:29,500
 effectively bringing an end to the war and the demise of the Ottoman Empire.

1636
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:35,500
 On November 11, the armistice went into effect, and the guns fell silent across Europe.

1637
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:47,500
 World War II, the peace was short-lived because a man named Adolf Hitler invaded Poland.

1638
02:29:47,500 --> 02:29:55,500
 Like Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Trajan, Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan, Napoleon Bonaparte,

1639
02:29:55,500 --> 02:30:02,500
 and Suleiman the Great, Adolf Hitler wanted to establish an empire for his nation and his people.

1640
02:30:02,500 --> 02:30:07,500
 Adolf had dreams of building an empire larger than anything that was ever created.

1641
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:11,500
 He wanted to make the Roman Empire look like nothing.

1642
02:30:11,500 --> 02:30:17,500
 However, for the sake of the world, and especially those Hitler viewed as undesirable vermin,

1643
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:23,500
 in April 1945, Soviet forces began a massive assault on Berlin.

1644
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:30,500
 After weeks of intense fighting, the city fell on May 2nd, and German forces surrendered.

1645
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:38,500
 Meanwhile, Allied forces were closing in from the West, and on May 7, Germany signed an unconditional surrender,

1646
02:30:38,500 --> 02:30:41,500
 officially ending the war in Europe.

1647
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:47,500
 A few months later, after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan surrendered as well,

1648
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:51,500
 leaving the war to be over.

1649
02:30:56,500 --> 02:31:01,500
 From World War II on, the world has faced a technological revolution.

1650
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:07,500
 With Alan Turing's invention of the computer during the war, the world became global.

1651
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:11,500
 For 50 years, America and the Soviet Union were at war,

1652
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:15,500
 despite the fact that they were on two totally different continents.

1653
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:20,500
 In 1969, Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, saying

1654
02:31:20,500 --> 02:31:27,500
 "It's one small step for man, but I am free for mankind."

1655
02:31:27,500 --> 02:31:33,500
 As the years on the world has become increasingly smaller, computers have become more affordable.

1656
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:36,500
 Cell phones change the way we communicated with one another.

1657
02:31:36,500 --> 02:31:42,500
 Let's go back to the story of a man named Gilgamesh on his quest for immortality.

1658
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:48,500
 At the end of the poem, Gilgamesh realizes, "Life, which you look for, you will never find."

1659
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:52,500
 Remember when God's created man, they let death be his share,

1660
02:31:52,500 --> 02:31:55,500
 and life withheld in their own hands.

1661
02:31:55,500 --> 02:32:01,500
 The history of human civilizations is an incomplete book, constantly being updated.

1662
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:03,500
 Some things will never change.

1663
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:06,500
 However, humans will always die.

1664
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:10,500
 Empires will always rise and fall.

1665
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:14,500
 The masses will always clamor towards safety.

1666
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:37,500
